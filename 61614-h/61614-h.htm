<h2 id="ch2"><span class="h2line1">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<h2 id="ch3"><span class="h2line1">I. CHURCH ORDERS</span></h2>
<p>The early Church Orders were systematic manuals of
disciplinary and liturgical rules for which the collective
authority of the whole apostolate was claimed. They made
their appearance in the second century, grew to considerable
dimensions in the third, and reached their fullest
development toward the end of the fourth century. They
are sources of importance for our knowledge of the inner
life of the church, and they were influential factors in the
formation of the later canon law.</p>
<p>That legislation of a fairly detailed and elaborate character
should sooner or later make its appearance in
Christianity was inevitable. The local congregations were
made up of men and women practically isolated from the
rest of the world and brought into the closest contact with
one another; their church was to them almost their entire
universe. If human beings anywhere are to live together
under such conditions, mutual affection and forbearance&mdash;be
they never so great&mdash;are not enough. Regulations,
which define rights and duties in unambiguous terms,
are indispensable, and these regulations are bound to
increase in number and complexity as the community
grows.</p>
<p>As it happened, however, Christianity in its origins contained
extraordinarily little material that could be used in
forming these regulations. In theory Christians, for guidance
in all matters, were to turn to Jesus Christ their Lord,
whose teaching they regarded as totally divine and so the
final authority in all things. But, as a matter of fact,
Jesus&rsquo; concern was not with concrete and specific problems,
and when asked to rule on such he brusquely
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
refused.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> He occupied himself with ultimate moral principles,
and left to individuals the task of applying these
principles to the various special problems of their lives.
Hence it is not at all surprising that in the apostolic and
post-apostolic ages direct citation of his sayings is rarely
used to settle disputed matters of practice;<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> his words are
employed rather as general directives and to give inspiration
to action.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Nor did the apostles attempt in any systematic way to
supply the concrete element that Jesus&rsquo; teaching might
be thought to lack. In only one instance<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> does the New
Testament give us anything that purports to be an apostolic
decree, and it gives this only in a matter of fundamental
importance. Yet even this brief ruling presents
serious critical difficulties to modern investigators, and
probably something less than full apostolic authority
should be accorded it. In St Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, indeed, it is
laid down as a fundamental principle that individual
divergences should be tolerated as far as possible even in
the same community,<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> so that the apostle turns from
general principles to detailed regulations only in the most
extreme instances. Each of his churches was left free to
develop under the guidance of the Spirit such customs as
it might judge profitable&mdash;and was warned not to make
even these customs too authoritative. And there is no
reason to think that the other apostles differed greatly from
St Paul in this regard. That some of them may have drawn
up certain specific rules for their own communities is
abstractly conceivable, but as to this there is no tradition
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
at all in the sources of the apostolic age and nothing of any
value in later writings.</p>
<p>As a consequence, Christian congregations in search for
material to use for legislative purposes could find very
little in the primary authoritative teaching of their religion,
and were obliged to look elsewhere. But abundant other
sources were not lacking.</p>
<p>Of these the chief was the Old Testament, whose importance
to the majority of early Christians can hardly be
exaggerated. The ceremonial legislation of the Pentateuch
was, to be sure, no longer regarded as binding on Christians;
the Pauline controversies had settled this principle,
even though a dissenting minority did not disappear until
late in the second century. But acceptance of the principle
did not debar endless debate as to the principle&rsquo;s precise
extent: just what Mosaic precepts should be classed as
&ldquo;purely ceremonial&rdquo;? St Paul, for instance, saw no inherent
objection to eating things sacrificed to idols,<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> but
in the decree of Acts 15. 28-29 abstinence from such food
is regarded as axiomatically &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> and Christians
during the next three centuries generally took the same
view. The duty of Christian liberality was defined more
closely by the adoption of the Jewish law of tithing, and
this law was even extended to include not only agricultural
produce but income of any kind.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> Or, even when the
literal force of an Old Testament precept was recognized
as superseded, a transferred sense might be discovered that
revived the rule for Christianity. So the command that
tithes should be paid to the priests was construed to give
the church&rsquo;s ministers a right to the Christian payments.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a>
Or the fact that the Old Testament ministry was strictly
regulated led to the argument that divine regulations of
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
equal strictness must hedge about the Christian ministry
as well.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Since so much permanent value was detected in the
older ceremonial legislation, it was only natural that the
obligation of the &ldquo;moral&rdquo; laws should usually be treated
as absolute. This led to a true moral legalism; that is, these
laws were conceived to demand obedience not because of
a higher principle contained in them but simply because
they were &ldquo;written&rdquo;. Such, for instance, is the assumption
throughout Clement&rsquo;s letter to the Corinthians, where
almost every argument is made to rest ultimately on an
Old Testament precept. Nor does it occur at all to
Clement that the Corinthians may find anything amiss in
his method; he takes for granted that, no matter how much
other parts of the Old Testament may have lost their
meaning, God&rsquo;s moral statutes will remain in immutable
force for ever. And, we can scarcely doubt, such was a
common opinion in Christianity from the very beginning,
outside of Pauline and a few other circles; it was an attitude
very like Clement&rsquo;s that St Paul combated in his Epistle to
the Romans.</p>
<p>This common opinion, moreover, was strongly reinforced
by pedagogical needs. The sweep of the new religion
and its gathering in converts from all sorts of curious moral
highways and hedges had created a situation that taxed
to the uttermost the powers of the Christian teachers.
Multitudes of neophytes were constantly demanding instruction,
and to teach each one of them how to apply
Christ&rsquo;s deeper principles to involved special problems
seemed utterly impracticable; why engage in so intricate
a task when a succinct Old Testament precept could settle
the matter instantly? So catechetical moral training was
usually given by means of short digests based on Old
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
Testament laws, some of these digests being undoubtedly
of Jewish origin.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> But it is interesting to note that the most
authoritative brief digest of Jewish morality&mdash;the Decalogue&mdash;does
not appear as a whole in the Christian
teaching.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>In Gentile Christianity concrete rules were taken likewise
from Greek ethical works, whose standard was usually
high. Only the learned, of course, could appreciate the
moral treatises of the great philosophers, but a long succession
of teachers&mdash;chiefly Stoics&mdash;had devoted themselves
to bringing an understanding of good conduct within the
reach of all. Among other means, these teachers achieved
their purpose by requiring their pupils to memorize short
gnomic formulas, or&mdash;the ultimate extremity of simplification&mdash;bare
lists of virtues to be imitated or vices to be
avoided.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> This last device was so convenient that even
Greek-speaking Jews adopted it,<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> and Christians found it
invaluable. In fact they did not hesitate to take ready-made
lists from Stoic and other sources,<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> so giving Greek
ethical concepts an unnoticed but authoritative entrance
into Christianity.</p>
<p>Less formal but very real was the influence of established
customs and conventions&mdash;on occasion, even superstitions&mdash;in
contemporary life, whether Jewish or Gentile. St Paul,
for instance, in 1 Corinthians 11. 4 holds it to be obvious
that men should pray with their heads uncovered, and this
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
passage has influenced all subsequent Christian practice.
Yet the ruling rests on nothing more profound than the
religious habits of the particular Jews among whom St Paul
was brought up; other Jews in his day believed that God
should be approached only when the head was covered,
and this came to be the accepted Jewish practice. If St
Paul had lived elsewhere&mdash;or if he had been born somewhat
later&mdash;the declaration in 1 Corinthians 11. 4 would
have shocked him.</p>
<p>To these customs inherited from their pre-conversion
days, the various local churches gradually added customs
of their own. Some of these were certainly introduced for
very good reasons, others perhaps for no particular reason
and more or less accidentally. But in religious bodies
everywhere customs quickly grow to be revered simply
because they <i>are</i> the custom, and are clung to tenaciously.
Yet, to a certain degree, the churches were willing to learn
from one another. The Christian communities in any geographical
subdivision of the Empire had strong interests in
common, and, in particular, they recognized as right and
proper a certain leadership on the part of the church in
their political capital. So the customs of this church were
generally accepted as models for the whole region, with
the result that by the end of the second century &ldquo;local&rdquo; use
was quite generally converted into &ldquo;provincial&rdquo; use. And
very large and important churches&mdash;especially Antioch,
Alexandria and Rome&mdash;gained a corresponding ascendency
over the smaller capitals within their respective areas.</p>
<p>In some instances, in fact, rulings by outstanding churches
or individuals might acquire an almost world-wide influence.
1 Clement, which states the Roman conception
of certain rules governing the ministry, was accepted as
authoritative in circles far away from the Corinthians for
whom it was written. Indeed, many Christians came
actually to regard it as an inspired New Testament writing,
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
and in various later documents Clement figures as the
medium through whom the apostles issued their decrees.
Of equal significance was Ignatius of Antioch, whose directions
on church organization appear to have been obeyed
even in Rome itself. Just so later Church Orders were
regarded as legally binding in provinces remote from their
place of origin.</p>
<p>In most quarters this trend toward uniformity in the
second century was simply taken for granted. Practices
with a century of tradition<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> behind them were practically
treated as irreformable: &ldquo;This custom has been handed
down from the days of the apostles and consequently has
the apostles&rsquo; authority behind it&rdquo;. But even by the end of
the first century the apostles were regarded as a wholly
inspired group, who were the divinely appointed custodians
and interpreters of the faith.<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> Hence, it was commonly
assumed, they must have been unanimous in all things;
what one apostle taught all apostles must have taught. All
Christianity rests on a common norm of doctrine and practice
that was delivered to the church by the apostles.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>
<p>It is this conviction that lies behind the Church Orders
and that gives them their peculiar form.</p>
<p>The most obvious objection to this theory, naturally,
was the very evident fact that approved practices in
different localities varied considerably; these could not all
go back to a common origin. And in minor matters,
assuredly, second- and third-century Christianity tolerated
or even encouraged<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> differences. But in anything regarded
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
as important local divergences could lead to bitter conflict.
When the second-century Asia Minor churches were asked
to change their date for Easter, they replied, &ldquo;We must
obey God rather than men&rdquo;, and a schism in the church
resulted.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> And in this clash apostolic authority was passionately
claimed by both sides, with the constant premise
that such authority must in the main lead to uniformity.</p>
<p>Yet there were definite limits to the process of unification.
As the generations grew into centuries, the general
&ldquo;ethos&rdquo; of the more important local types of Christianity
acquired a venerable dignity that commanded respect even
from churches whose customs were different. In major
matters of practice, moreover, a substantial agreement had
been achieved, and the churches were organized along the
same main lines everywhere. So when any church claimed
apostolic teaching in support of special usages of its own&mdash;and
such claims were made frequently&mdash;it usually did so
fully aware that other churches could make similar claims
with equal validity, and that its special usages might very
well have been different. This fact led to a revision of the
theory of apostolic unanimity. The complete agreement
of the apostles was now thought to extend only to doctrine
and the vitally important rules of practice; in other regards
each apostle within his own territory had established a use
of his own&mdash;and each of these uses was equally legitimate.
So Alexandria appealed to St Mark, Jerusalem to St James,
Ephesus to St John, Rome to St Peter, and so on; in due
course the far east was to appeal to St Thomas or St
Thaddeus.</p>
<p>Such a theory was not entirely novel; Irenaeus, for instance,
urged it in an unsuccessful attempt to settle the
paschal controversy. But as local customs became fixed
the theory was more and more invoked, and it finally
became a settled principle throughout Christendom. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
fourth century was here the definite turning point; when
the ecumenical councils met, they made no attempt to
legislate in full details for the whole church. So when the
compiler of the Apostolic Constitutions <i>ca.</i> 375 revived the
Church Order formula that made all the apostles legislate
minutely, we may presume that he was consciously adopting
a style that was already somewhat obsolescent; Christians
by now were becoming aware that collective apostolic
authority could not be claimed for so wide an extent of
regulations. And this consciousness brought with it the
eventual end of the Church Orders; they were replaced by
explicitly local collections of canons and by liturgical service
books. Yet in many parts of the church the old Church
Orders retained their authority, and they were incorporated
into the manuals of canon law.</p>
<p class="tb">The following are the chief Church Orders:</p>
<h3>THE DIDACHE</h3>
<p>As this work is familiar to everyone its contents need not
be described. Most scholars date it in the early years of the
second century, but the possibility that its compiler used
the Epistle of Barnabas as a source cannot be wholly
disregarded.<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> Barnabas is usually dated about 131, with
a possibility of belonging some fifteen years earlier, so if the
dependence is accepted the Didache could scarcely have
originated before the second quarter of the century and
may even be somewhat later.</p>
<p>The influence of the Didache in the early church was
wide and it was held in high honour. It was incorporated
into the Didascalia, the Apostolic Church Order and the
Apostolic Constitutions. So eminent and orthodox a saint
as Athanasius speaks of it as a book very profitable for neophytes
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
&ldquo;who wish for instruction in the word of godliness&rdquo;,<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a>
and he cites it as an authority more than once, even though
he&mdash;very properly&mdash;refuses to recognize it as a canonical
New Testament writing.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a> There consequently can be no
reasonable doubt that the Didache originated in the broad
stream of orthodox Christian tradition, not in some obscure
heretical sect.</p>
<p>Much the most convenient edition of the Greek text is
that edited by Dr Hans Lietzmann in his <i>Kleine Texte</i>
series;<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> it contains an excellent critical apparatus and is
very inexpensive. There are many accessible English
translations.</p>
<h3>THE APOSTOLIC TRADITION</h3>
<p>This work of Hippolytus, the subject of the present volume,
is named here to preserve the chronological sequence. In
its Coptic and other versions it was formerly known as the
Egyptian Church Order.</p>
<h3>THE DIDASCALIA</h3>
<p>A substantial &ldquo;handbook for the churches&rdquo;, written probably
in Syria, not far either way from 250. Its original
language was Greek, but it has been preserved in Syriac and
Latin; the latter is defective. It is concerned almost wholly
with rules for church organization, church finance and
church discipline, treating doctrine hardly at all and
liturgical matters only incidentally. Its author was acquainted
with the more important Christian literature of
the second century, and there is some evidence that he
knew Hippolytus&rsquo;s Apostolic Tradition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>The Didascalia is best studied in Dom R. H. Connolly&rsquo;s
English version,<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> which he has provided with judicious introduction
and notes. Attention should be directed to his
words on p. xlv: &ldquo;It is now generally recognized that the
author&rsquo;s theological outlook was entirely Catholic, and
that he writes as a champion of the Great Church as
opposed to all manner of heresy and schism&rdquo;.</p>
<h3>THE APOSTOLIC CHURCH ORDER</h3>
<p>This work<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> so nearly resembles the Didache in both size
and arrangement that there is good reason to believe that
it was originally issued as a &ldquo;revised&rdquo; edition of the older
work. Chapters 1-3 describe a meeting of the Twelve
Apostles at which they decided to publish this Order.
Chapters 4-13 are Didache 1-4, slightly rearranged and
expanded. Chapter 14 is apparently derived from Barnabas
14 and closes with Didache 4. 13. Chapters 15-28
treat of church organization, beginning with the election
of bishops and ending with the duties of women: the conditions
described indicate a date not earlier than the end
of the third century. Chapter 29 contains an adjuration to
charity and chapter 30 a final appeal to apostolic authority.</p>
<p>This Order, whose orthodoxy is unimpeachable, was
written in Greek and is probably (not certainly) of Egyptian
origin. Its popularity is shown by the fact that Latin,
Syriac, Sahidic, Bohairic, Ethiopic and other versions
have been preserved, as well as the original Greek. A complete
critical edition has not yet been prepared. The best
edition of the Greek text is in Theodor Schermann&rsquo;s <i>Die
allgemeine Kirchenordnung</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> 1, pp. 1-34. The English versions,
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
such as they are, are not very accessible, but the translations
of the Ethiopic, Arabic and Sahidic in Horner are
adequate.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a></p>
<h3>THE APOSTOLIC CONSTITUTIONS</h3>
<p>This, the most ambitious of all the Church Orders, undertook
to provide a practically complete treatise on church
law and liturgics by collecting and revising earlier authoritative
sources. Books <span class="small">I-VI</span> are an enlarged edition of the
Didascalia. Chapters 1-32 of Book <span class="small">VII</span> treat the Didache
similarly; chapters 33-45 contain a collection of prayers
obviously based on Jewish synagogue forms; the source of
chapters 46-49 is uncertain. Chapters 1-2 of Book <span class="small">VIII</span> are
now generally held to utilize a lost work of Hippolytus,
<i>Concerning Gifts</i>. Chapters 3-46 contain his Apostolic
Tradition, greatly expanded, especially in the so-called
Clementine Liturgy<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> of chapters 6-15.</p>
<p>The Constitutions were compiled around 375, either in
Syria or Constantinople. The author had no hesitation
about drastically rewriting archaic material, but the great
bulk of his expansions are simply expository and homiletic.
His verbosity is irksome to modern readers, but it was quite
in accord with the taste of his age. Theologically he shows
Arian leanings, but these are often rather difficult to detect
without comparing his text with its sources; his work as a
whole is certainly not &ldquo;Arian&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The extent of the later influence of the Constitutions has
not yet been satisfactorily estimated. That the work in its
entirety was not apostolic was recognized at once and
various church councils branded it as apocryphal. But
later writers not infrequently cite passages from the Constitutions
as authoritative; these citations as a whole, however,
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
have not thus far been collected and analysed.
Apparently the most influential part of the book was its
&ldquo;Clementine Liturgy&rdquo;, which deeply influenced subsequent
Eastern rites.</p>
<p>The classic edition of the Greek text is that of Funk. The
English translation in the <i>Ante-Nicene Fathers</i> is generally
adequate.</p>
<h3>THE APOSTOLIC CANONS</h3>
<p>A collection of eighty-five canons, appended to the Constitutions.
They were compiled by its author partly from
earlier synodic sources, partly from the Constitutions
themselves. In the Eastern Church these canons were
accepted as a whole and were translated into many
languages; in the Western Church only the first fifty were
received.</p>
<h3>THE EPITOME</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The Epitome of the Eighth Book of the Apostolic Constitutions&rdquo;
is the title&mdash;and something of a misnomer&mdash;for
what is little more than a copy of the sections of this Book
of the Constitutions that deal with organization and discipline.
It is divided into five parts, A-E. The first two
chapters of the Constitutions are reproduced in A, chapter
32 in C, chapter 46 in E. D contains chapters 33-34,
42-45, practically intact.</p>
<p>B is headed &ldquo;The Constitutions of the Holy Apostles
concerning Ordination through Hippolytus&rdquo;, a title not
infrequently<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> used to describe the entire work as &ldquo;The
Constitutions through Hippolytus&rdquo;. It begins with chapter
3 of the Constitutions, describing the election of a bishop.
But the ordination prayer that follows is taken directly
from Hippolytus&rsquo;s Apostolic Tradition, not from the Constitutions.
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
Then comes chapter 16 of the Constitutions on
the ordination of presbyters. The opening sentences are
given literally, but the ordination prayer is about midway
in length between the compact version in Hippolytus and
the elaborate wording of the Constitutions. Chapters
18-21 are copied with minimal variations, but in chapter
22 the ordination of readers is dismissed in a brief sentence
from Hippolytus. Chapters 23-28 and 30-31, almost
unchanged, conclude the section.</p>
<p>Even as late as the beginning of the twentieth century
the Epitome was often taken to be a source used in the
Constitutions. But this is now recognized to be wrong: the
Epitome is extracted from the Constitutions, with a few
reversions to Hippolytus. As it contains nothing independent
there is no way to judge its date or place of origin.</p>
<p>The Greek text will be found in Funk, <span class="small">II</span>, pp. 72-96.
The three passages that really differ from the Constitutions
are translated in the present volume.<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a></p>
<h3>THE TESTAMENT OF OUR LORD</h3>
<p>This work is divided into two Books, of 47 and 27 chapters
respectively. In Book <span class="small">I</span>, after an apocalyptic introduction
in chapters 1-13, the risen Christ solemnly declares
(chapters 14-18) to the apostles the divine obligation of
the rules that follow. The remainder of the work is based
on Hippolytus&rsquo;s Apostolic Tradition, although often greatly
changed and expanded: there are added, for instance,
rules for church architecture, descriptions of clerical duties
and much liturgical matter. But Hippolytus&rsquo;s order is
faithfully followed and his text is often reproduced verbally.
Book <span class="small">I</span>, chapter 28, a &ldquo;mystagogic&rdquo; treatise on Christology
in semi-credal form, is perhaps a later addition.</p>
<p>The date of the Testament is probably a little later than
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
that of the Constitutions; in any case it is hardly earlier
than 360. For its place of origin Syria, Asia Minor and
Egypt all have their advocates, with Egypt probably the
least likely. The original Greek is lost, but the work has been
transmitted in Syriac, Ethiopic and Arabic. Its Christology
has an &ldquo;Apollinarian&rdquo; flavour, but &ldquo;there is no actual
heresy in the Testament&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a> The English version of Cooper
and Maclean is standard, although certain of their
elaborate notes now require revision.</p>
<h3>THE CANONS OF HIPPOLYTUS</h3>
<p>A work containing thirty-eight &ldquo;canons&rdquo;, which &ldquo;Hippolytus,
the chief of the bishops of Rome, wrote according
to the commands of the apostles&rdquo;. This paraphrase for his
&ldquo;Apostolic Tradition&rdquo; indicates the source with an explicitness
unusual in a Church Order. Its alterations are
much less radical than those in the Testament, and
wholly new matter is limited to a brief introduction and
an appendix concerned chiefly with moral and ascetic
directions. The revision was made almost certainly in the
fifth century and beyond reasonable doubt in Egypt.</p>
<p>The text (originally Greek) has been preserved only in
an Arabic version. The only reliable edition is the German
translation by Riedel; an English version is badly needed.</p>
<p>For the sake of completeness there may be added:</p>
<h3>SARAPION&rsquo;S PRAYERS</h3>
<p>This work is not a true Church Order: it makes no pretence
to apostolic origin and consists wholly of a collection of
prayers drawn up by Sarapion, bishop of Thmuis, about
350. It opens with the celebrant&rsquo;s part at the eucharist and
closes with various benedictions. The eucharistic prayer
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
has been strongly influenced by the Didache, the ordination
prayers by Hippolytus. The most accessible edition of
the Greek text is in Funk, <span class="small">II</span>, pp. 158-195. Bishop John
Wordsworth edited an excellent English translation.</p>
<h2 id="ch4"><span class="h2line1">II. HIPPOLYTUS</span></h2>
<p>Hippolytus is a unique figure in Christian history, for he,
a schismatic bishop of Rome, is honoured by the Roman
church as a saint and martyr. This curious combination of
qualities made him for centuries a highly enigmatic personality,
of whom almost nothing was known. Many of
his voluminous works were preserved and studied, and
were translated into Syriac, Coptic, Arabic, Armenian and
even Old Slavic. But his creation of a schism and his
acceptance of its episcopate were acts so contrary to
established principles that Eusebius, writing less than a
century later, can describe him only as the bishop &ldquo;of a
church somewhere&rdquo;;<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> to which description Jerome adds:
&ldquo;the name of whose city I have been unable to learn&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a>
That this city was in fact Rome is, to be sure, stated by not
a few late patristic and medieval writers, especially in the
East, but these do not hint that there was anything irregular
about his tenure. Or he is assigned sees in widely
different localities, sometimes as far off as Arabia and
sometimes as near Rome as Portus: this last place&mdash;due,
apparently, to confusion with some other martyr&mdash;was
especially popular. But among Western writers Hippolytus&rsquo;s
episcopal rank is commonly ignored and he appears
simply as &ldquo;a presbyter&rdquo;: the present Roman Catholic
service books<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a> do not call him &ldquo;bishop&rdquo;. The sole general
agreement was as to the date of his death, which the
martyrologies and other early testimony place about 235.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>In 1551 excavations in Rome brought to light a third-century
statue of Hippolytus, now in the Lateran Museum;
the upper part of the body has been &ldquo;restored&rdquo;. On the
sides are inscribed an &ldquo;Easter Canon&rdquo; that he computed
and a partial list of his works.<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a> The posture of the body,
which is that of a seated teacher, made episcopal dignity
more than probable, so for the official description of
the statue Pius IV, the next pope, adopted the Portus
tradition. Hence as &ldquo;Bishop of Portus&rdquo; the saint was
generally known until the middle of the nineteenth
century.</p>
<p>In 1701 Jakob Gronov published, in the tenth volume
of his <i>Thesaurus Graecarum Antiquitatum</i>, Book <span class="small">I</span>&mdash;no more
was then known&mdash;of a work called &ldquo;Philosophumena&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Philosophizings&rdquo;, that was commonly, although not universally,
referred to Origen. Books <span class="small">IV-X</span> of this work were
discovered in 1842 and nine years later were published as
Origen&rsquo;s by the editor, B. E. Miller.<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a> But the contents of
the work were soon proved by competent scholars&mdash;notably
D&ouml;llinger<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a>&mdash;to make Origen&rsquo;s authorship impossible;
the necessary conditions were fulfilled by Hippolytus
alone. This proof established also the Hippolytean
authorship of certain other disputed works; and the evidence
thus assembled showed that Hippolytus was both a
bishop and a Roman. Incidentally, it has been established
also that the correct title for the above work is &ldquo;Refutation
of All Heresies&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;Philosophumena&rdquo; was the
sub-title of Books <span class="small">I-IV</span> (not as is sometimes stated of Book <span class="small">I</span>
alone). But &ldquo;Philosophumena&rdquo; is generally accepted by
modern writers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The Portus tradition, however, still lingered on for a
time and is accepted in the <i>Ante-Nicene Fathers</i>, both by
the original editor J. H. Macmahon (1868) and by the
American reviser Bishop A. C. Coxe (1886). Bishop
Lightfoot supported a compromise theory that made of
Hippolytus a sort of suffragan bishop of Rome with special
jurisdiction over Portus.<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a> But neither position is now
tenable.</p>
<p>For the facts of Hippolytus&rsquo;s life we have practically only
what he himself tells us in scattered allusions; only once
(Philosophumena <span class="small">IX</span>, 7) does he relate contemporary
events at any length. Since in his later works he speaks of
himself as aged, his birth must be placed <i>ca.</i> 160. Tradition
makes him a disciple of Irenaeus, a highly probable supposition
even though his works are silent on the subject.
He became a presbyter of the Roman church under
Zephyrinus (198?-217, or perhaps earlier) and won great
respect for his learning and eloquence: on one occasion
he was deputed to preach in the presence of Origen.<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a>
But his learning brought him into a mortal conflict with a
fellow presbyter, one Callistus.</p>
<p>This Callistus had had in earlier years a career that was
at least ambiguous. The servant of a wealthy Christian, he
was permitted by his master to undertake in Rome the
experiment of a &ldquo;Christian bank&rdquo;, in which many of the
faithful deposited their savings. As has usually been the
case with such experiments, the bank failed, and in this
case no assets could be discovered. Callistus fled, but was
brought back to Rome and sentenced to the treadmill.
After a while he was released and sought to regain favour
with the Christians by interrupting a Jewish synagogue
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
service and preaching Christianity to the congregation.<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a>
For this he was sent to the Sardinian convict mines. All of
this appears to have taken place during the ninth decade
of the second century; in any case Callistus was still a
prisoner when Bishop Victor succeeded in obtaining from
the Emperor Commodus the release of many Christian
prisoners in the year 190 or thereabouts.<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a> The list of
names drawn up by Victor and sent to Sardinia did not
include Callistus, but he contrived to secure his discharge
as well, and he returned to Italy as at least technically a
&ldquo;martyr&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a> Victor, however, did not permit him to remain
in Rome and dismissed him to Antium, where he lived
until Victor&rsquo;s death, receiving from the church&rsquo;s fund a
monthly allowance that enabled him to avoid suffering.</p>
<p>Victor was succeeded by Zephyrinus, an easy-going man
of small intelligence, who in past years had conceived an
intense admiration for Callistus. He immediately recalled
the latter to Rome, ordained him presbyter,<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a> and made
him his chief lieutenant; during Zephyrinus&rsquo;s episcopacy
Callistus was the real power at Rome. His only significant
rival was Hippolytus.</p>
<p>Two more different men can scarcely be imagined. Both
were equally determined to have their own way. But
Callistus was suave and ingratiating, little concerned with
theological speculation, desirous of immediate practical
results and none too scrupulous as to ways and means,
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
indifferent to precedents and perfectly willing to try
novel experiments. Hippolytus was dour and irascible,<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a>
convinced that meticulous theology must be maintained
though the heavens fell, scandalized at the mere thought
of relaxing discipline, a traditionalist to his finger tips,
who believed that any new idea was necessarily Satanic.
Between such antagonists a relentless war was inevitable.</p>
<p>They appear to have fought on most questions, but one
cause of conflict was paramount: Christology. During the
second century the church was constantly tormented by
the problem of reconciling the rigid monotheism inherited
from the Jews with the divine honours that were
unquestioningly paid to Christ. The solution that Hippolytus
proposed followed in general the doctrine of the
Fourth Gospel: God from before creation has begotten<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a>
from Himself His Logos, itself divine. This doctrine rests
on speculative metaphysical premises that are none too
easy of comprehension; to many thinkers in the second
century it seemed either (<i>a</i>) to subordinate the Son to the
Father in such a way as to detract from the Son&rsquo;s true
divinity, or (<i>b</i>) to make of the Son an independent deity
and so destroy monotheism. Hippolytus endeavoured to
avoid both extremes, but with what success specialists&mdash;ancient
or modern&mdash;are unable to agree; it must be
remembered, however, that he wrote as a pioneer in an
age when the real questions were not yet clearly stated, let
alone answered, and that he employed a philosophy
originally devised for a very different purpose. The most
popular alternative to his theory was what is rather cumbrously
known as &ldquo;modalistic monarchianism&rdquo;; this was
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
quite within the grasp of the most unphilosophical, since
it disregarded all metaphysical refinements. It argued:
&ldquo;We worship Christ as God, and God is One. Therefore
Christ is God and God is Christ; &lsquo;Father&rsquo; and &lsquo;Son&rsquo; are
only titles that describe the same Person in different aspects
or &lsquo;modes&rsquo;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Later on this modalism was regarded as heresy of the
most extreme type, but even in the late second century it
was widely taught and was uncondemned; in part the
church authorities wished to preserve peace above all
things and in part they were really in doubt as to the points
at issue. Many teachers, to be sure, attacked it violently
and none with greater passion than Hippolytus, who at the
beginning of the third century was making the Roman
church hot with his invectives. But, despite him, when
Sabellius, the great apostle of modalism, came to Rome he
was received cordially by Zephyrinus and Callistus.</p>
<p>Still, even Hippolytus was forced to admit that Sabellius
was an honest and open-minded man, and one with whom
he could argue so frankly that he had great hopes of converting
him. But Callistus interfered. Not that he himself
was quite a modalist; his own Christology, while having
strong modalistic leanings, was saved from downright
modalism by dexterous qualifications. But he regarded
Hippolytus&rsquo;s doctrine&mdash;which he probably could not really
understand&mdash;as the worse of the two evils. So Sabellius,
finding the two great Roman leaders at loggerheads,
reverted to his former position. To Hippolytus this was the
last straw and he publicly denounced Callistus<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a> as a
heretic. Callistus retorted by hurling at Hippolytus the
final insult: &ldquo;Ditheist!&rdquo; The result was a schism.</p>
<p>It took place, apparently, in the last years of Zephyrinus,<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a>
who died in 217. Hippolytus and his disciples fled
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
from the&mdash;to them&mdash;polluted and heretical communion of
the regular bishop and proclaimed that they and they alone
were the true church of Rome. They were not numerous
but their standing appears to have been high; at any rate
they were able to find bishops willing to consecrate their
leader to the episcopate. But their withdrawal left the
&ldquo;regular&rdquo; church completely under Callistus&rsquo;s control,
and at Zephyrinus&rsquo;s death he was elected to succeed him.
This election, of course, Hippolytus treated as wholly null,
asserting contemptuously that what Callistus had done was
to become the leader of a &ldquo;school of Callistans&rdquo;, not of a
&ldquo;church of Christians&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Callistus disposed of the Christological controversy by
excommunicating both Sabellius and Hippolytus, and then
turned his attention to the most thorny practical question
that perplexed contemporary Christians, the problem of
mortal sin after baptism. From the beginning of the post-apostolic
age<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a> the church almost universally held that such
sin could not receive absolution, so that the sinners were
permanently excommunicate and without hope of restoration.<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a>
The only &ldquo;orthodox&rdquo; voice in opposition to
this rigorism was raised by the Shepherd of Hermas, and
even its author dared oppose the universal teaching of his
age only because he had received a special revelation from
God; nor did he venture to promise more than the remission
of <i>one</i> post-baptismal sin for anyone. In many
quarters, indeed, even this mild relaxation of the rule was
passionately resisted, and the most vigorous religious movement
of the second century&mdash;Montanism&mdash;took as its
watchword, &ldquo;No second remission!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the beginning of the third century a final settlement
of the question had become a necessity. The Christians had
been successful beyond their dreams in attracting converts,
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
but probably the majority possessed only general good
moral qualities and lacked the heroic virtues. What was
to be done with them? Should the church dismiss them as
unworthy and so reduce its numbers drastically? Or should
it do what it could for those whose intentions were good,
without expecting too much of them? To Hippolytus the
church&rsquo;s constant teaching since the apostles&rsquo; time removed
the problem from debate: Christians must be saints
in the fullest sense of the word. So his flock was constantly
purged by excommunications. Callistus, on the contrary,
took the bold step of brushing aside tradition altogether
and of appealing directly to the New Testament: &ldquo;Let the
tares grow with the wheat until the harvest&rdquo;,<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a> and, &ldquo;Who
art thou that judgest another man&rsquo;s servant?"<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a> Sinners
were, of course, put to penance, but if they proved their
good faith they could be absolved, no matter what their
offence nor how often it had been committed. This decision
of Callistus was nothing short of revolutionary, and it was
destined to change the ideal of church membership for all
time. Naturally it shocked Hippolytus beyond measure&mdash;and
his horror was intensified when those whom he himself
had excommunicated were received into communion by
Callistus.</p>
<p>The latter, in fact, went so far in the abolition of the
stricter rules that his own successors at Rome withdrew or
seriously modified some of his concessions. He pronounced
that second and even third marriages constituted no impediment
to ordination, and allowed clerics to marry after
they had been ordained. And he declined to recognize for
Christian marriage the impediment of disparity of status
in the Roman civil law; as a result the church permitted
marriages that the parties could disown to the state&mdash;with
some curious consequences.</p>
<p>All of this so incensed Hippolytus and his party that
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
Callistus&rsquo;s death in 222 did not end the schism; it continued
under his successors Urbanus (222-230)&mdash;of whom
nothing is certainly known&mdash;and Pontianus (230-235).
But in 235 Maximinus became emperor and he undertook
a persecution that singled out the Christian leaders. So in
Rome both Pontianus and Hippolytus were arrested and
sent to Sardinia, where they shortly afterward succumbed
to the hardships of convict life. This healed the breach in
the church, and the reunited factions completed the
reconciliation by pronouncing both bishops to be saints
and martyrs.</p>
<p>This action has been taken by some scholars&mdash;arguing
from the premises of a later day&mdash;as evidence that Hippolytus
made a retractation before his death. But Hippolytus
was not the man to retract anything. And the
Roman church of the next generation would never have
allowed the erection of his statue if they had held him to be
saved only by a deathbed repentance; still less would they
have permitted the public and honourable inscription of
the titles of works in which he glories in his conduct.<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a> The
church really acknowledged that both sides had made mistakes,
and that Hippolytus&rsquo;s errors&mdash;whatever they may
have been&mdash;were due to an excess of zeal for righteousness
and were not to be weighed against his consecrated learning
and his burning devotion.</p>
<h3>THE APOSTOLIC TRADITION</h3>
<p>For a list and description of Hippolytus&rsquo;s works reference
must be made to the treatises on patrology; he was a
prolific writer on exegetical, doctrinal and practical
themes, who published at least fifty books and probably
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
many more. But after he had been consecrated bishop of
his separatist congregation, his first task was to provide
treatises to perpetuate the principles for which he was contending
so bitterly. One of these was <i>Of Gifts</i>, to which he
alludes in <a href="#tch1_1">1. 1</a>; it has not been preserved, although traces
appear to be incorporated in Constitutions <span class="small">VIII</span>, i-ii. And
it was followed immediately by the Apostolic Tradition.</p>
<p>Its introduction fixes its date and purpose. A &ldquo;lapse or
error&rdquo; had &ldquo;recently occurred&rdquo; (<a href="#tch1_4">1. 4</a>), and Hippolytus
undertakes to guard against its effects by setting forth the
true doctrine &ldquo;which has continued up to now&rdquo;. And he
recurs to the same theme at the close: &ldquo;the many heresies
have increased because their leaders would not learn the
purpose of the apostles&rdquo;, but &ldquo;over all who hear the
apostolic tradition and keep it, no heretics or any other
man will prevail&rdquo; (<a href="#tch38_2">38. 2</a>-3). The date accordingly must
be close to 217 and the purpose is to cleave to the old ways,
rejecting every innovation; the tradition which Hippolytus
received from the presbyters before him (<a href="#tch36_12">36. 12</a>) must be
maintained inviolate.</p>
<p>In content the book consists mainly of laws for church
organization and the conduct of worship, but these are
interspersed freely with comment and explanation. The
source of the laws themselves is not doubtful: they represent
the normal practices at Rome in Hippolytus&rsquo;s younger
days, and he is quite sincere in believing that they are truly
apostolic and therefore unalterable. And that they actually
are rules of real antiquity is shown by the corroboration
they receive from other early Christian writers, among
whom Tertullian in particular describes usages extraordinarily
like those expounded by his Roman contemporary.
The Apostolic Tradition, consequently, is more
than a source for Roman customs at the beginning of the
third century; it may with equal safety be invoked for the
practice of thirty or even fifty years earlier. In the words
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
of Harnack:<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a> &ldquo;Here is the richest source that we in any
form possess for our knowledge of the polity of the Roman
church in the oldest time, and this Roman polity may, in
many regards, be accepted as the polity held everywhere&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The same, naturally, cannot always be said of the material
in Hippolytus&rsquo;s comments. Here too, unquestionably,
much is inherited; it is for one of his explanations that he
appeals to the presbyters in <a href="#tch36_12">36. 12</a>. But it is occasionally
evident&mdash;<a href="#tch9">chapter 9</a> is an instance&mdash;that the ceremonies he
faithfully describes do not fully accord with his interpretations,
and that he himself does not invariably understand
his material. Some of the wording of his prayers, moreover,
is unmistakably his own, but in his day (<a href="#tch10_4">10. 4</a>-6) each
Christian leader still felt free to frame prayers as he would.</p>
<p>Hippolytus designed his work for &ldquo;the churches&rdquo; (<a href="#tch1_3">1. 3</a>),
a phrase most naturally understood of Christendom at
large. His own church of Rome appears to have appreciated
his work the least, for the majority of Roman
Christians gave their allegiance to his rivals and accepted
their legislation; it was the reforms of Callistus and not
the conservatism of Hippolytus that directed subsequent
Roman polity. Probably, too, despite his canonization, his
memory was always slightly suspect; the Roman church
certainly managed to forget very quickly who he really was.
By the middle of the third century, moreover, his church
finally abandoned Greek as its official language and became
wholly Latinized, so that his writings were no longer
accessible. And what was true of Rome was true of the
West in general.</p>
<p>In the East, however, especially in Egypt and Syria,
Hippolytus&rsquo;s work was accepted as possessing high authority.
It was of course not treated as infallible, for later
legal writers do not hesitate to amend or omit laws disagreeing
with local usage. Yet the title Hippolytus chose
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
for his work was taken really seriously,<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a> and he, more
than any other Church Father, gave the laws and the
liturgy of the Eastern Church their permanent form.</p>
<p>The Apostolic Tradition was first made known to the
Western world in 1691 by Job Ludolf in <i>Ad suam Historiam
Aethiopicam Commentarius</i>; in this he published in incomplete
form the Ethiopic work containing it, to which he gave the
title&mdash;still in use&mdash;of <i>Statuta Apostolorum</i>. But he naturally
was unable to identify the author. It was not until 1848
that the next contribution was made, Tattam&rsquo;s <i>The
Apostolic Constitutions or Canons of the Apostles in Coptic</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a> which
gave the Bohairic text with an English translation. The
Sahidic text appeared thirty-five years later on pp. 248-266
of Lagarde&rsquo;s <i>Aegyptiaca</i>, and this is still the standard
edition. A German translation (by Steindorff) was published
in 1891 by Achelis in his <i>Die &auml;ltesten Quellen des orientalischen
Kirchenrechtes</i>:<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a> this monograph opened the really
critical study of the material and is not yet wholly obsolete.
But Hauler&rsquo;s discovery of the Latin text was the most
important event of all. He published his find in 1900 but
did not appreciate the full importance of what he describes
only as &ldquo;Aegyptiorum reliquiae&rdquo; at the end of his long
title.<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a> And even such an intensely able scholar as Funk, in
making his own Latin version of &ldquo;The Egyptian Church
Order&rdquo;, still preferred to follow the Sahidic.<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a> Horner&rsquo;s
<i>Statutes of the Apostles</i> (1904) finally supplied critical Ethiopic
and Arabic texts, with scientifically literal translations of
these and of the Sahidic as well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>The basic significance of the Latin version was glimpsed
by Cooper and Maclean in their edition of the Testament<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a>
(1902); their use of &ldquo;Hauler&rdquo; is often penetrating. In
1906 Baron Eduard von der Goltz<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a> finally identified certain
sections as definitely Hippolytean, and four years later
Dr Eduard Schwartz reached the definite conclusion:<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a>
the Latin text represents substantially what Hippolytus
wrote. Dr Schwartz&rsquo;s monograph, however, was brief and
left many problems unexplored; the detailed demonstration
was the&mdash;wholly independent&mdash;work of Dom
Connolly in 1916.</p>
<p>In 1928 Dr Jungklaus published a German translation
of Hippolytus&rsquo;s work, with an elaborate introduction; in
some regards it proved unsatisfactory but it should on no
account be neglected.</p>
<p>The textual evidence is as follows:</p>
<p class="tb">The original Greek of chapters 3 and 12 is preserved
in the Epitome, and that of 25. 1-2 in the Vienna fragment
printed (e.g.) by Funk (<span class="small">II</span>, p. 112). The Constitutions also
give some aid in reconstructing the Greek text elsewhere.</p>
<p>The Latin codex, now in Verona, is a palimpsest,<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a> probably
of the sixth century, over which some two centuries
later three books of Isidore of Seville&rsquo;s <i>Sentences</i> were
written. The translation itself appears to have been made
in the fourth century, and is a rendition of a Greek book of
church laws, in which Hippolytus&rsquo;s book is preceded by
portions of the Didascalia and the complete Apostolic
Church Order. The translator, who presumably had no
idea of the authorship of the closing portion, made his
version pedantically literal; a great advantage to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
modern student. Unquestionably neither the sixth-century
copyist, the translator nor the Greek text used was infallible;
the last certainly contained duplications.<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a> But the
version is incomparably the best guide that we have. It
includes 1. 1-9. 11a, 21. 14-24. 12a, 26. 3b-38. 2a.</p>
<p>The Oriental manuscripts, all comparatively modern,<a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a>
are fairly numerous,<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a> and are likewise collections of laws.
The Sahidic&mdash;known also as the Egyptian Heptateuch,
from its seven Books&mdash;begins with the Apostolic Church
Order. Then (Book <span class="small">II</span>) comes Hippolytus&rsquo;s work, in which
chapters 1, 3, 4. 4-13, 5-6, 8. 2-5, 9. 9-12 are omitted and
chapters 11-14 are arranged in the order<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a> 12, 14, 11, 13;
there are also minor variations to which attention is
usually called in the translation and notes. Books <span class="small">III-VI</span>
are parallel to Constitutions <span class="small">VIII</span>; Book <span class="small">VII</span> contains the
Apostolic Canons. Like other Coptic ecclesiastical writings
it teems with transliterated Greek words, so that the
original terms are obvious. But the first translator was
evidently often in doubt as to the meaning of the original,
and his indecisions have not been clarified by later
copyists.</p>
<p>The Bohairic was made from an inferior Sahidic manuscript
in the early nineteenth century. All readings of any
consequence are listed by Horner.</p>
<p>The Arabic was made from the Sahidic, which it
follows in most regards, although chapters 11-14 are not
disarranged; it was therefore made from a manuscript
other than the archetype of the known Sahidic codices and
has a certain independent textual value. Otherwise its
features are just about those to be expected in a secondary
version.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>The Ethiopic is divided into seventy-two &ldquo;Statutes&rdquo;, of
which the first twenty-one are the Apostolic Church Order.
Statute 22 = Hippolytus&rsquo;s chapters 2-5, concluding with
communion prayers. Chapter 6 of Hippolytus is omitted.
Statutes 23-27 = chapters 8-15, with no changes in order.
Statutes 28-35 = chapters 16-24, concluding with a brief
additional section on the regular weekly eucharists (<a class="pgref" href="#Page_58">p. 58</a>).
Statutes 36-38 = chapters 25-26, followed by sections on
the communion of the sick and on evening services (<a class="pgref" href="#Page_58">p. 58</a>)
and a repetition of chapter 26. 2, 10b-13. Statute 39 =
chapter 27. Statute 40 is a long baptismal office, containing
reminiscences of chapters 21-23 but opening with
chapter 1, which is not in the Sahidic or Arabic. Statutes
40 (end)-48 = chapters 28-38. The remaining Statutes
parallel Constitutions <span class="small">VIII</span>, like the other versions, but
there are certain variations; Statute 52, for instance, contains
a considerable section of the Didache, a little of the
Didascalia, and a bit (38. 4) of Hippolytus. At the end
there is a collection of prayers.</p>
<p>The Ethiopic is a tertiary version, made from the Arabic.
Statute 40, which gives chapter 1, was evidently derived
from a different source which used the Apostolic Tradition
independently, and its inclusion here was more or less
accidental. But the presence of the other chapters not in
the present Arabic texts is best explained by assuming that
the Ethiopic was derived from an older Arabic form&mdash;which
in turn presupposes an older Sahidic form; in these
the omissions to avoid conflict with local usages had not
yet taken place.<a class="fn" id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a></p>
<p>The additional material in Statutes 5, 35 and 37-38 is
printed by both Connolly and Jungklaus, although both<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a>
recognize the liturgical prayers in 5 to be post-Hippolytean;
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
it is consequently not included in the present
edition. But neither do the other two sections appear to
be genuine. The rules in Statute 35 are so general and unobjectionable
that their omission in the Sahidic and Arabic
would be difficult to explain, while the reverence deacons
must pay to presbyters seems to point to a later date.
Similarly the description of the care of the sick and of the
evening service in Statute 37 presents nothing that could
have troubled the Sahidic and Arabic translators; the
insertion of such widespread usages is easier to understand
than their omission. And the repetition of earlier matter at
the end of Statute 37 and in all of Statute 38 shows a bad
textual tradition.</p>
<p>In general, then, the evidence of the Ethiopic is of
minor consequence. In the only place where it stands alone
(9. 11-12) it has a text that does not appear to be possible.</p>
<p>Summarizing: The original Greek of the Apostolic
Tradition has not been recovered, except in small fragments.
The Latin is generally trustworthy, but is incomplete.
The only other primary version, the Sahidic, is likewise
incomplete, and the results of the moderate abilities
of its translator have been further confused in later transmission.
The Arabic is a secondary text, offering little that
the Sahidic does not contain. The only practically complete
version,<a class="fn" id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a> the Ethiopic, is tertiary and is otherwise
unreliable. All four of these versions presuppose a common
Greek original, in which two different endings have been
conflated. The other sources, the Constitutions, the Testament
and the Canons, are frank revisions, in which the
original is often edited out of recognition or even flatly
contradicted. Under these conditions the restoration of a
really accurate text is manifestly impossible.</p>
<p>None the less the material is abundant and independent
enough to warrant confidence that the substance and in
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
most cases even the original wording of Hippolytus&rsquo;s rules
have really been preserved: only the ordination prayer
for deacons presents difficulties that appear insuperable.</p>
<p>The chapter divisions are those of Jungklaus, altered only
at chapter 22. To facilitate reference the sentences have
been numbered as &ldquo;verses&rdquo;.</p>

this is the reason why the bishop alone shall lay his
hands upon him: he is not ordained to the priesthood

commands. &sup3;He does not take part in the council of the
clergy; he is to attend to his own duties and to make
known to the bishop such things as are needful. <a id="tch9_4">&#8308;He</a>
does not receive that Spirit that is possessed by the
presbytery, in which the presbyters share; he receives
only what is confided in him under the bishop&rsquo;s
authority.</p>
<p><a id="tch9_5">&#8309;For</a> this cause the bishop alone shall make a deacon.
&#8310;But on a presbyter, however, the presbyters shall lay
their hands because of the common and like Spirit of
the clergy. &#8311;Yet the presbyter has only the power to receive;
but he has no power to give. &#8312;For this reason a
presbyter does not ordain the clergy; but at the ordination
of a presbyter he seals while the bishop ordains.</p>

and the dead? &sup1;&#8310;And when he says:</p>
<p>I believe,</p>
<p>he is baptized again. &sup1;&#8311;And again he shall say:</p>
<p>Dost thou believe in [the] Holy Ghost, and the holy
church, and the resurrection of the flesh?</p>
<p>&sup1;&#8312;He who is being baptized shall say accordingly:</p>
<p>I believe,</p>
<p>and so he is baptized a third time.<a class="fn" id="fr_116" href="#fn_116">[116]</a></p>
<p>&sup1;&#8313;And afterward, when he has come up [out of the
water], he is anointed by the presbyter with the oil of
thanksgiving, the presbyter saying:</p>
<p>I anoint thee with holy oil in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&sup2;&#8304;And so each one, after drying himself, is immediately
clothed, and then is brought into the church.</p>
<p class="tb"><a id="tch22" href="#teh22">22.</a><a class="fn" id="fr_117" href="#fn_117">[117]</a> &sup1;Then the bishop, laying his hand upon them,
shall pray, saying:</p>
<p><span class="fl">O Lord God</span>, who hast made them worthy to
obtain remission of sins through the laver of regeneration
of [the] Holy Spirit, send into them
thy grace, that they may serve thee according to thy
will; for thine is the glory, to the Father and the Son,
with [the] Holy Spirit in the holy church, both now and
world without end. Amen.<a class="fn" id="fr_118" href="#fn_118">[118]</a></p>
<p><a id="tch22_2">&sup2;Then,</a> pouring the oil of thanksgiving from his hand and
putting it on his forehead, he shall say:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>I anoint thee with holy oil in the Lord, the Father
Almighty and Christ Jesus and [the] Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>&sup3;And signing them on the forehead he shall say:</p>
<p>The Lord be with thee;</p>
<p>and he who is signed shall say:</p>
<p>And with thy spirit.</p>
<p>&#8308;And so he shall do to each one.</p>
<p>&#8309;And immediately thereafter they shall join in prayer
with all the people, but they shall not pray with the
faithful until all these things are completed. <a id="tch22_6">&#8310;And</a> at the
close of their prayer they shall give the kiss of peace.</p>
<p class="tb"><a id="tch23" href="#teh23">23.</a> &sup1;<a id="tch23_1">And</a> then the offering is immediately brought by
the deacons to the bishop, and by thanksgiving he shall
make the bread into an image<a class="fn" id="fr_119" href="#fn_119">[119]</a> of the body of Christ,
and the cup of wine mixed with water according to the
likeness<a class="fn" id="fr_120" href="#fn_120">[120]</a> of the blood, which is shed for all who believe
in him. <a id="tch23_2">&sup2;And</a> milk and honey mixed together for the
fulfilment of the promise to the fathers, which spoke of
a land flowing with milk and honey; namely, Christ&rsquo;s
flesh which he gave, by which they who believe are
nourished like babes, he making sweet the bitter things
of the heart by the gentleness of his word. &sup3;And the
water into an offering in a token of the laver, in order
that the inner part of man, which is a living soul, may
receive the same as the body.</p>
<p>&#8308;The bishop shall explain the reason of all these
things to those who partake. &#8309;And when he breaks the
bread and distributes the fragments he shall say:</p>
<p>The heavenly bread in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><a id="tch32_6">&#8310;And</a> the recipient shall say, Amen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&#8311;And the presbyters&mdash;or if there are not enough presbyters,
the deacons&mdash;shall hold the cups, and shall
stand by with reverence and modesty; first he who holds
the water, then the milk, thirdly the wine. &#8312;And the
recipients shall taste of each three times, he who gives
the cup saying:</p>
<p>In God the Father Almighty;</p>
<p>and the recipient shall say, Amen. &#8313;Then:</p>
<p>In the Lord Jesus Christ;</p>
<p>[and he shall say, Amen.
<a id="tch23_10">&sup1;&#8304;Then:</a></p>
<p>In]<a class="fn" id="fr_121" href="#fn_121">[121]</a> [the] Holy Ghost and the holy church;</p>
<p>and he shall say, Amen. &sup1;&sup1;So it shall be done to each.</p>
<p>&sup1;&sup2;And when these things are completed, let each one
hasten to do good works,<br />
<span class="sn">SAH</span>and to please God and to live aright, devoting himself
to the church, practising the things he has learned,
advancing in the service of God.</p>
<p><a id="tch23_13">&sup1;&sup3;Now</a> we have briefly delivered to you these things
concerning the holy baptism and the holy oblation, for
you have already been instructed concerning the resurrection
of the flesh and all other things as taught in
Scripture.<a id="tch23_14">&sup1;&#8308;Yet</a> if there is any other thing that ought to
be told [to converts], let the bishop impart it to them
privately after their baptism; let not unbelievers know
it, until they are baptized: this is the white stone of
which John said: &ldquo;There is upon it a new name written,
which no one knoweth but he that receiveth the stone&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>PART III</h3>
<p><span class="sn">GRE<a class="fn" id="fr_122" href="#fn_122">[122]</a></span><a id="tch25" href="#teh25">25.</a><a class="fn" id="fr_123" href="#fn_123">[123]</a> <a id="tch25_1">&sup1;Widows</a> and virgins shall fast frequently and
shall pray for the church; presbyters, if they wish, and
laymen may fast likewise. <a id="tch25_2">&sup2;But</a> the bishop may fast only
when all the people fast.</p>
<p class="tb"><a id="tch26" href="#teh26">26.</a> &sup1;For it constantly happens that some one wishes
to make an offering&mdash;and such a one must not be
denied&mdash;and then the bishop, after breaking the bread,
must in every case taste<br />
<span class="sn">SAH</span>and eat it with the other believers. &sup2;[At such an offering]
each shall take from the bishop&rsquo;s hand a piece of [this]
bread before breaking his own bread. [This service has
a special ceremonial]<a class="fn" id="fr_124" href="#fn_124">[124]</a> for it is &ldquo;a Blessing&rdquo;, not &ldquo;a
Thanksgiving&rdquo;, as is [the service of] the Body of the
Lord.<a class="fn" id="fr_125" href="#fn_125">[125]</a> &sup3;But before drinking, each one,<br />
<span class="sn">LAT</span>as many of you as are present,<br />
<span class="sn">SAH</span>must take a cup and give thanks over it,<br />
<span class="sn">LAT</span>and so go to your meal.</p>
<p>&#8308;But to the catechumens is given exorcised bread, and
each of them must offer the cup. <a id="tch26_5">&#8309;No</a> catechumen shall
sit at the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.</p>
<p>&#8310;But at each act of offering, the offerer must remember
his host, for he was invited to the latter&rsquo;s home for that
very purpose. &#8311;But when you eat and drink, do so in an
orderly manner and not so that anyone may mock, or
your host be saddened by your unruliness, but behave
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
so that he may pray to be made worthy that the saints
may enter his dwelling: &ldquo;for ye&rdquo;, it is said, &ldquo;are the
salt of the earth&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&#8312;If the offering should be one made to all the guests
jointly,<a class="fn" id="fr_126" href="#fn_126">[126]</a> take your portion from your host [and depart].
&#8313;But if all are to eat then and there, do not eat to excess,
so that your host may likewise send some of what the
saints leave to whomsoever he will and [so] may rejoice
in the faith.</p>
<p>&sup1;&#8304;But while the guests are eating, let them eat silently,
not arguing, [attending to]<a class="fn" id="fr_127" href="#fn_127">[127]</a> such things as the bishop
may teach, but if he should ask any question, let an
answer be given him; and when he says anything, everyone
in modest praise shall keep silence until he asks
again.</p>
<p>&sup1;&sup1;And even if the bishop should be absent when the
faithful meet at a supper, if a presbyter or a deacon is
present they shall eat in a similar orderly fashion, and
each shall be careful<a class="fn" id="fr_128" href="#fn_128">[128]</a> to take the blessed bread from the
presbyter&rsquo;s or deacon&rsquo;s hand; and in the same way the
catechumens shall take the same exorcised bread.</p>
<p>&sup1;&sup2;But if [only] laymen meet, let them not act presumptuously,
for a layman cannot bless the blessed bread.<a class="fn" id="fr_129" href="#fn_129">[129]</a></p>
<p>&sup1;&sup3;Let each one eat in the name of the Lord; for this is
pleasing to the Lord that we should be jealous [of our
good name] even among the heathen, all sober alike.<a class="fn" id="fr_130" href="#fn_130">[130]</a></p>
<p class="tb"><a id="tch27" href="#teh27">27.</a> &sup1;If anyone wishes to give a meal to widows of
mature years, let him dismiss them before evening. &sup2;But
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
if, on account of existing conditions,<a class="fn" id="fr_131" href="#fn_131">[131]</a> he cannot [feed
them in his house], let him send them away, and they
may eat of his food at their homes in any way they please.</p>
<p class="tb"><a id="tch28" href="#teh28">28.</a> &sup1;As soon as first-fruits appear, all shall hasten to
offer them to the bishop. &sup2;And he shall offer them, shall
give thanks and shall name him who offered them,
saying:</p>
<p>&sup3;<span class="fl">We</span> give thee thanks, O God, and we offer thee the
first-fruits; which thou hast given us to enjoy,
nourishing them through thy word, commanding
the earth to bring forth her fruits for the gladness
and the food of men and all beasts. &#8308;For all these things
we praise thee, O God, and for all things wherewith
thou hast blessed us, who for us adornest every creature
with divers fruits. &#8309;Through thy Servant Jesus Christ,
our Lord, through whom be to thee glory, world without
end. Amen.</p>
<p>&#8310;Only certain fruits may be blessed, namely grapes,
the fig, the pomegranate, the olive, the pear, the apple,
the mulberry, the peach, the cherry, the almond, the
plum. &#8311;Not the pumpkin, nor the melon, nor the cucumber,
nor the onion nor garlic nor anything else having
an odour.</p>
<p>&#8312;But sometimes flowers too are offered; here the rose
and the lily may be offered, but no other.</p>
<p>&#8313;But for everything that is eaten shall they [who eat it]
give thanks to the Holy God, eating unto His glory.</p>
<p class="tb"><a id="tch29" href="#teh29">29.</a> &sup1;<a id="tch29_1">Let</a> no one at the paschal season<a class="fn" id="fr_132" href="#fn_132">[132]</a> eat before the
offering is made,<a class="fn" id="fr_133" href="#fn_133">[133]</a> otherwise he shall not be credited with
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
the fast. &sup2;But if any woman is with child, or if anyone is
sick and cannot fast for two days, let such a one, on
account of his need, [at least] fast on Saturday, contenting
himself with bread and water. &sup3;But if anyone on
a voyage or for any other necessary cause should not
know the day, when he has learned the truth he shall
postpone his fast until after Pentecost. &#8308;For the ancient
type has passed away, and so the [postponed] fast [of
Numbers 9. 11] in the second month has ceased, and
each one ought to fast in accord with his knowledge of
the truth.<a class="fn" id="fr_134" href="#fn_134">[134]</a></p>
<p class="tb"><a id="tch30" href="#teh30">30.</a> &sup1;Each of the deacons, with the subdeacons, shall
be alert on the bishop&rsquo;s behalf, for the bishop must be
informed if any are sick so that, if he pleases, he may
visit them; for a sick man is greatly comforted when the
high priest is mindful of him.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sn">SAH</span><a id="tch33" href="#teh33">33.</a><a class="fn" id="fr_135" href="#fn_135">[135]</a> &sup1;Let the deacons and the presbyters assemble
daily at the place which the bishop may appoint; let the
deacons [in particular] never fail to assemble unless
prevented by sickness. &sup2;When all have met they shall instruct
those who are in the church, and then, after
prayer, each shall go to his appointed duties.</p>
<p class="tb"><a id="tch34" href="#teh34">34.</a> &sup1;No exorbitant charge shall be made for burial in
the cemetery, for it belongs to all the poor; only the
hire of the grave-digger and the cost of the tile [for
closing the niche in the catacombs] shall be asked. &sup2;The
wages of the caretakers are to be paid by the bishop,
lest any of those who go to that place be burdened [with
a charge].</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<h3>PART IV</h3>
<p><a id="tch35" href="#teh35">35.</a> &sup1;Let all the faithful, whether men or women,
when early in the morning they rise from their sleep and
before they undertake any tasks, wash their hands and
pray to God; and so they may go to their duties. &sup2;But if
any instruction in God&rsquo;s word is held [that day], everyone
ought to attend it willingly,<a class="fn" id="fr_136" href="#fn_136">[136]</a> recollecting that he
will hear God speaking through the instructor and<a class="fn" id="fr_137" href="#fn_137">[137]</a> that
prayer in the church enables him to avoid the day&rsquo;s evil;
any godly man ought to count it a great loss if he does
not attend the place of instruction, especially if he can
read.</p>
<p>&sup3;If a [specially gifted]<a class="fn" id="fr_138" href="#fn_138">[138]</a> teacher should come, let none
of you delay<a class="fn" id="fr_139" href="#fn_139">[139]</a> to attend the place where the instruction
is given, for grace will be given to the speaker to utter
things profitable to all, and thou wilt hear new things,<a class="fn" id="fr_140" href="#fn_140">[140]</a>
and thou wilt be profited by what the Holy Spirit will
give thee through the instructor; so thy faith will be
strengthened by what thou hearest, and in that place
thou wilt learn thy duties at home; therefore let everyone
be zealous to go to the church, the place where the
Holy Spirit abounds.<a class="fn" id="fr_141" href="#fn_141">[141]</a></p>
<p class="tb"><a id="tch36" href="#teh36">36.</a> &sup1;But if on any day there is no instruction, let
everyone at home take the Bible and read sufficiently
in passages that he finds profitable.</p>
<p>&sup2;If at the third hour thou art at home, pray then and
give thanks to God; but if thou chance to be abroad at
that hour, make thy prayer to God in thy heart. &sup3;For at
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
that hour Christ was nailed to the tree; therefore in the
old [covenant] the law commanded the showbread to
be offered continually for a type of the body and blood
of Christ, and commanded the sacrifice of the dumb
lamb, which was a type of the perfect Lamb; for Christ
is the Shepherd, and he is also the Bread that came
down from heaven.</p>
<p>&#8308;At the sixth hour likewise pray also, for, after Christ
was nailed to the wood of the cross, the day was divided
and there was a great darkness; wherefore let [the
faithful] pray at that hour with an effectual prayer,
likening themselves to the voice of him who prayed
[and] caused all creation to become dark for the unbelieving
Jews.</p>
<p>&#8309;And at the ninth hour let a great prayer and a great
thanksgiving be made, such as made<a class="fn" id="fr_142" href="#fn_142">[142]</a> the souls of the
righteous ones, blessing the Lord,<br />
<span class="sn">LAT</span>the God who does not lie, who was mindful of his
saints and sent forth his Word to enlighten them. &#8310;At that
hour, therefore, Christ poured forth from his pierced
side water and blood, and brought the rest of the time
of that day with light to evening; so, when he fell asleep,
by making the beginning of another day he completed
the pattern of his resurrection.</p>
<p>&#8311;Pray again before thy body rests on thy bed.</p>
<p>&#8312;At midnight arise, wash thy hands with water and
pray. &#8313;And if thy wife is with thee, pray ye both together;
but if she is not yet a believer, go into another room and
pray, and again return to thy bed; be not slothful in
prayer.</p>
<p>&sup1;&#8304;He who has used the marriage bed is not defiled; for
they who are bathed have no need to wash again, for
they are clean. <a id="tch36_11">&sup1;&sup1;By</a> signing thyself with thy moist
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
breath, and so spreading spittle<a class="fn" id="fr_143" href="#fn_143">[143]</a> on thy body with thy
hand, thou art sanctified to thy feet; for the gift of the
Spirit and the sprinkling with water, when it is brought
with a believing heart as it were from a fountain,
sanctifies him who believes.</p>
<p><a id="tch36_12">&sup1;&sup2;It</a> is needful to pray at this hour; for those very elders
who gave us the tradition taught us that at this hour all
creation rests for a certain moment, that all creatures
may praise the Lord: stars and trees and waters stand
still with one accord, and all the angelic host does service
to God by praising Him, together with the souls of
the righteous. &sup1;&sup3;For this cause believers should be zealous
to pray at this hour; for the Lord, testifying to this, says:
&ldquo;Behold at midnight is a cry, Behold the Bridegroom
cometh! Rise up to meet him!&rdquo;; and he adds insistently:
&ldquo;Watch ye therefore, for ye know not at what
hour he cometh&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&sup1;&#8308;And at cockcrow rise up and pray likewise, for at that
hour of cockcrow the children of Israel denied Christ,
whom we have known by faith; by which faith, in the
hope of eternal life at the resurrection of the dead, we
look for his Day.</p>
<p>&sup1;&#8309;And so, all ye faithful, if ye thus act, and are mindful
of these things, and teach them to one another, and
cause the catechumens to be zealous, ye can neither be
tempted nor can ye perish, since ye have Christ always
in your minds.</p>
<p class="tb"><a id="tch37" href="#teh37">37.</a><a class="fn" id="fr_144" href="#fn_144">[144]</a> &sup1;But imitate him always, by signing thy forehead
sincerely; for this is the sign of his Passion, manifest and
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
approved against the devil if so thou makest it from
faith; not that thou mayest appear to men, but knowingly
offering it as a shield. &sup2;For the adversary, seeing
its power coming from the heart, that a man displays
the publicly formed image of baptism,<a class="fn" id="fr_145" href="#fn_145">[145]</a> is put to flight;
not because thou spittest, but because the Spirit in thee
breathes him away. &sup3;When Moses formed it by putting
the blood of the Paschal lamb that was slain on the
lintel and anointing the side-posts, he signified the faith
which now we have in the perfect Lamb.</p>
<p class="tb"><a id="tch38" href="#teh38">38.</a><a class="fn" id="fr_146" href="#fn_146">[146]</a> &sup1;And so, if these things are accepted with thanksgiving
and right faith, they give edification in the church
and eternal life to believers. <a id="tch38_2">&sup2;I</a> counsel that these things
be kept by all who know aright; for over all who hear
the apostolic tra[dition]<br />
<span class="sn">SAH</span>and keep it, no heretics or any other man will prevail to
lead them astray. &sup3;For the many heresies have increased
because their leaders would not learn the purpose
of the apostles but acted according to their own
wills, following their lusts and not what was right.</p>
<p><a id="tch38_4">&#8308;Now,</a> beloved, if we have omitted anything, God will
reveal it to those who are worthy, guiding the holy
church to its mooring in [God&rsquo;s] quiet haven.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<h3>LATER ADDITIONS</h3>
<p><span class="sn">ETH</span><a id="tch24">24.</a> &sup1;On Saturday and Sunday the bishop shall whenever
possible give the people the bread with his own hand, while
the deacons break it. &sup2;The presbyters too shall break the
bread to be delivered; and whenever a deacon approaches
a presbyter he shall hold out his robe,<a class="fn" id="fr_147" href="#fn_147">[147]</a> and the presbyter
shall take the bread and deliver it to the people with his
hand.</p>
<p>&sup3;On other days they shall give the bread as the bishop
determines.</p>
<p>On this section compare <a class="pgref" href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>. It may be further observed
that section 2 is pretty clearly an addition.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sn">ETH</span>26. &sup1;&#8308;In time of need the deacon shall be diligent in giving
the blessed bread<a class="fn" id="fr_148" href="#fn_148">[148]</a> to the sick. &sup1;&#8309;If there is no presbyter to give
out what is to be distributed, the deacon shall pronounce
the thanksgiving and shall supervise<a class="fn" id="fr_149" href="#fn_149">[149]</a> those who carry it
away, to make sure that they attend to their duty and [properly]
distribute the blessed food; the distributors must give
it to the widows and the sick. &sup1;&#8310;Whoever is entrusted with the
duty by the church<a class="fn" id="fr_150" href="#fn_150">[150]</a> must distribute it on the same day; if
he does not, he must [at least] do so on the next day with
the addition of what is then given him. &sup1;&#8311;For [it is not his own
property]; it is given him only [in trust] as bread for the
poor.</p>
<p>&sup1;&#8312;When evening has come and the bishop is present, the
deacon shall bring in a lamp. &sup1;&#8313;Then the bishop, standing in
the midst of the believers, before giving thanks shall first
give the salutation:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The Lord be with you all.</p>
</div>
<p>&sup2;&#8304;And the people shall say:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">[And] with thy spirit.</p>
</div>
<p>&sup2;&sup1;And the bishop shall say:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Let us give thanks to the Lord.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&sup2;&sup2;And the people shall say:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It is meet and right:</p>
<p class="t0">Majesty, exaltation and glory are due to Him.</p>
</div>
<p>&sup2;&sup3;But they shall not say &ldquo;Lift up your hearts&rdquo;, for that belongs
to the oblation. &sup2;&#8308;And he prays thus, saying:</p>
<p>We give thee thanks, O God, because thou hast enlightened
us by revealing the incorruptible light. &sup2;&#8309;So we,
having finished the length of a day, and being come to the
beginning of the night, satisfied with the light of the day that
thou hast created for our satisfaction; and now, since by thy
grace we lack not a light for the evening, we sanctify thee
and we glorify thee. &sup2;&#8310;Through thine only Son our Lord Jesus
Christ, through whom be to thee with him glory and might
and honour with [the] Holy Spirit, now, etc.<a class="fn" id="fr_151" href="#fn_151">[151]</a></p>
<p>&sup2;&#8311;And they shall all say: Amen.</p>
<p>&sup2;&#8312;Then, rising up after supper, the children and virgins
having prayed, they shall sing psalms. &sup2;&#8313;Then the deacon,
holding the mixed cup of the offering, shall say a Hallelujah
Psalm.<a class="fn" id="fr_152" href="#fn_152">[152]</a> &sup3;&#8304;Then, the presbyter having commanded, &ldquo;And
also such-and-such Psalms&rdquo;, after the bishop has offered
the cup<a class="fn" id="fr_153" href="#fn_153">[153]</a> with the proper thanksgiving, all shall say &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo;
as the Psalms are sung. &sup3;&sup1;And they shall say:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We praise Him who is God most high;</p>
<p class="t0">Glorified and praised is He,</p>
<p class="t0">Who founded the world with a single word.<a class="fn" id="fr_154" href="#fn_154">[154]</a></p>
</div>
<p>&sup3;&sup2;Then, when the Psalm is completed, he shall give thanks
over the bread, and shall give the fragments to all the
believers.</p>
<p>On these sections compare <a class="pgref" href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>. An evening service,
that included bringing in the lamp, is widespread in early
Christianity and is eventually derived from Judaism; the
particular service described here is a prelude to a congregational
agape. There is nothing in sections 18-32 that
necessarily implies a date later than Hippolytus, but the
ceremony is badly placed between the private agapes and
the equally private meals for the widows, and it is followed
by a duplication of 26. 2, 10-12.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="sn">LAT</span><a id="tch31">31.</a> &sup1;The faithful, early in the morning, as soon as they
have awaked and arisen, before they undertake their tasks
shall pray to God and so may then go to their duties. &sup2;But if
any instruction in the word is held, let each give first place
to that, that he may attend and hear the word of God, to his
soul&rsquo;s comfort; so let each one hasten to the church, where
the Spirit abounds.</p>
<p class="tb"><a id="tch32">32.</a> &sup1;But let each of the faithful be zealous, before he eats
anything else, to receive the eucharist; for if anyone receives
it with faith, after such a reception he cannot be harmed
even if a deadly poison should be given him. &sup2;But let each
one take care that no unbeliever taste the eucharist, nor a
mouse nor any other animal, and that nothing of it fall or be
lost; for the body of Christ is to be eaten by believers and
must not be despised. &sup3;The cup, when thou hast given thanks
in the name of the Lord, thou hast accepted as the image of
the blood of Christ. &#8308;Therefore let none of it be spilled, so
that no alien spirit may lick it up, as if thou didst despise it;
thou shalt be guilty of the blood, as if thou didst scorn the
price with which thou hast been bought.<a class="fn" id="fr_155" href="#fn_155">[155]</a></p>
<p class="tb">In the Oriental versions the position of chapters 31-32
between chapters 30 and 33 is impossible. Chapter 30
addresses the church&rsquo;s officers, chapters 31-32 individuals,
chapters 33-34 the officers, and chapter 35 individuals
again; chapter 31, in addition, is only a condensation of
35. 1-3. But the Hauler manuscript clears up the difficulty.
In it chapter 32 is followed immediately by the Latin A
form of 37. 1-38. 2a, breaking off at the end of a leaf with
&ldquo;apo&rdquo; (for &ldquo;apostolic&rdquo;). The next leaf begins with &ldquo;God&rdquo;
in the middle of 36. 5, and the text continues through 36,
gives the Latin B form of 37. 1-38. 2a and breaks off this
time with &ldquo;tra&rdquo; for &ldquo;tradition&rdquo;. So two versions of the
work were current with different endings; in one chapter 30
was followed by 31-32 and the A conclusion, in the other
it was followed by 33-35 and the B conclusion. In the
Hauler manuscript both endings were reproduced, although
the leaves containing the last two sentences of the first and
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
a considerable part of the second have been lost. In the
Oriental versions&mdash;or the Greek codex underlying them&mdash;the
glaring duplication caused by the ending after 32 was
suppressed, although the doubling of 35. 1-3 in 31 remained.</p>
<p>Since chapter 34 is unmistakably Roman and consequently
Hippolytean, the longer ending is original; chapter 33,
moreover, is perfectly in place after chapter 30. So
Schwartz<a class="fn" id="fr_156" href="#fn_156">[156]</a> and Jungklaus are correct in holding<a class="fn" id="fr_157" href="#fn_157">[157]</a> that chapter
32 is not by Hippolytus; the only alternative would be to
assume that he issued two versions of his book with different
endings&mdash;a difficult supposition that would leave unexplained
why the very important practice stressed in chapter
32 is omitted in the longer version.</p>
<p>On the other hand it is true, as Connolly argues,<a class="fn" id="fr_158" href="#fn_158">[158]</a> that
the rules of chapter 32 are truly third-century. The custom
according to which each Christian kept the consecrated
eucharist in his house and received it each morning is
attested in Tertullian&rsquo;s <i>To his Wife</i> <span class="small">II</span>, 5, and the reason
given (Mark 16. 18) for receiving fasting is not that of the
later church (compare on <a href="#teh29">chapter 29</a>); Connolly observes
further that the home reservation of consecrated wine as
well as consecrated bread is unknown elsewhere.</p>
<p>Very curious, too, is the phrase &ldquo;when <i>thou</i> hast given
thanks&rdquo; in section 3, for the section as a whole is addressed
to the laity. Is there here some reminiscence of earlier
corporately celebrated eucharists, like the agapes in <a href="#tch26">chapter 26</a>?
Or are 3-4 a later addition, addressed to the clergy?
Or is there textual confusion?</p>

<h2 id="ch6"><span class="h2line1">NOTES</span></h2>
<h3><a id="teh1" href="#tch1">1</a></h3>
<p>Characteristic of Hippolytus&rsquo;s style are his frequent
summaries of the progress of his treatises; compare
<a href="#tch16_25">16. 25</a>; <a href="#tch23_13">23. 13</a>; Philosophumena, Proem.; i, 23. 4, etc.</p>
<p>The opening sentence is obscure, but Connolly&rsquo;s explanation
(pp. 161-162) appears the most likely: Man,
made in God&rsquo;s image, went astray, but through the
Incarnation God restored humanity by presenting to
Himself Christ, the perfect Man.</p>
<p>2. On the phrase translated &ldquo;most important
theme&rdquo; compare Connolly, p. 161; the original Greek
word was presumably
<span title="koryph&ecirc;" class="g">&kappa;&omicron;&rho;&upsilon;&phi;&#8053;</span>.</p>
<p>3. If the &ldquo;churches&rdquo; are the different Roman congregations&mdash;an
unusual sense&mdash;Hippolytus speaks simply
as a bishop; if the meaning is &ldquo;at Rome and elsewhere&rdquo;
he speaks not only as a bishop but as a teacher
of eminent authority.</p>
<p>4. The &ldquo;lapse or error&rdquo; is the Zephyrinus-Callistus
&ldquo;schism&rdquo;. As Hippolytus speaks of it as a recent event,
the date of the treatise cannot be far from 217.</p>
<h3>PART I
<br />Ordination</h3>
<h3><a id="teh2" href="#tch2">2</a>
<br />THE BISHOP</h3>
<p>An episcopal election is still in the hands of the &ldquo;multitude&rdquo;
(compare Acts 6. 2), the clergy as yet having no
distinct voice in theory. Rather curiously no qualifications
are given for the bishop; contrast, e.g.,
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
1 Timothy 3. 2-7 or the expansions in the Constitutions
and the Testament. The bishop&rsquo;s functions are essentially
the same as in the Ignatian Epistles: as the embodiment
of his church&rsquo;s unity he is the centre and
head of all its activities, whether in teaching, worship,
or discipline.</p>
<p>The title &ldquo;high priest&rdquo;, however, is not used by
Ignatius, and in the extant Christian literature first
occurs in Tertullian, <i>On Baptism</i> 17 (<i>ca.</i> 205); Hippolytus
also uses &ldquo;high-priesthood&rdquo; of the episcopal
office in Philosophumena, Proem. 6. Similarly Tertullian
calls the presbyters &ldquo;priests&rdquo; in his <i>Exhortation
to Chastity</i> 7, 11 (<i>ca.</i> 210), and in <a href="#tch9_2">9. 2</a> of our treatise
Hippolytus describes their work as &ldquo;priesthood&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This appearance of sacerdotal titles for Christian
ministers&mdash;something that is foreign to the New Testament&mdash;was
a consequence of the adoption of sacrificial
terms for Christian worship:<a class="fn" id="fr_159" href="#fn_159">[159]</a> sacrifices are offered by
priests. So Didache 13. 3 describes the prophets as
&ldquo;your high priests&rdquo; (compare <a href="#tch15_1">15. 1</a>), while Ignatius
(<i>Philadelphians</i> 4) writes &ldquo;one altar, as one bishop&rdquo;.
Consequently it is more than probable that &ldquo;high
priest&rdquo; and &ldquo;priest&rdquo; were in common&mdash;although by no
means universal&mdash;use among Christians by the middle
of the second century. Hippolytus&rsquo;s distrust of innovations
corroborates this; apart from anti-modalist additions
the terminology of his consecration prayer can
scarcely be thought to depart much from the forms in
use in his younger days.</p>
<p>Otherwise the bishop is said to &ldquo;feed the flock&rdquo;, a
New Testament phrase<a class="fn" id="fr_160" href="#fn_160">[160]</a> that was of course traditional;
to Hippolytus it would include both correct teaching of
doctrine and faithful administration of the sacraments.
Since in Philosophumena <span class="small">IX</span>, 7 he inveighs fiercely
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
against Callistus&rsquo;s claim to absolve grave sins, &ldquo;to
remit&rdquo; here can refer only to minor offences. &ldquo;To
assign the lots&rdquo; strictly construed would mean &ldquo;to
appoint the clergy&rdquo;, but compare on <a href="#teh9">9. 1</a>. &ldquo;To loose
every bond&rdquo; is probably only a traditional liturgical
generality.</p>
<h3>THE CHRISTIAN &ldquo;SACRIFICES&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Sacrificial terms in the New Testament, except when
used to describe the Atonement, are employed within
Christianity only in a transferred sense: the Christian
sacrifices are either acts of righteousness,<a class="fn" id="fr_161" href="#fn_161">[161]</a> the rendering
of prayer and praise,<a class="fn" id="fr_162" href="#fn_162">[162]</a>
or gifts given to fellow-Christians.<a class="fn" id="fr_163" href="#fn_163">[163]</a>
In the post-apostolic age this last sense was
popular and in one particular application it was made
a definitely technical term. Christian worship and
Christian social life centred in a &ldquo;table-bond&rdquo;; the
specifically Christian act of worship was the eucharist,
which in apostolic times was regularly celebrated in
conjunction with a meal of some sort,<a class="fn" id="fr_164" href="#fn_164">[164]</a> and even in
Hippolytus&rsquo;s day had not lost all traces of the earlier
custom (chapters <a href="#tch5">5</a>-<a href="#tch6">6</a>). But the Christians were extremely
fond of other common meals as well, the
&ldquo;agapes&rdquo;, of a less sacred but still definitely religious
nature (<a href="#tch26">chapter 26</a>). In all of these meals the amount
of food required was considerable, and providing it
naturally entailed real expense. To supply this food,
consequently, was a meritorious act, which not only
satisfied the needs of the brethren but enabled the
church to hold a liturgical service, at which the food was
placed in the midst of the congregation and &ldquo;blessed&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_165" href="#fn_165">[165]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
Hence the various foods were naturally called &ldquo;offerings&rdquo;,
and from this it was only a short step to calling
the service itself a &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The word first appears in Didache 14. 1-2, where it is
used of the eucharist or (more probably) the eucharist-agape.
When the term was definitely adopted into the
Christian vocabulary, its further definition in Old
Testament language was inevitable. Here the nearest
analogue might have been found in the &ldquo;peace-offerings&rdquo;,
which were eaten by those who offered them.
But the Christians did not usually follow Levitical distinctions
closely, and Hippolytus (<a href="#tch3_5">3. 5</a>) speaks of the
bishop as &ldquo;propitiating God&rsquo;s countenance&rdquo;, language
that more properly belongs to the &ldquo;sin-offerings&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A special type of Christian offering were the first-fruits
(<a href="#tch28">chapter 28</a>), which were likewise solemnly presented
and &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; by the bishop. There were again
explicit Old Testament analogies, but in Christianity
&ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; did not permanently become a term for this
custom.</p>
<p>2. Notice of the election and of the Sunday appointed
for the consecration was sent to the neighbouring
churches, whose bishops would naturally attend as far
as they were able.</p>
<p>3. The assent of the people was given by acclamation;
according to the Canons in the form &ldquo;We choose
him!&rdquo; The explicit injunction that the presbyters must
not join in the imposition of hands should be noted; the
Arabic omits the prohibition, perhaps accidentally, but
the Canons read &ldquo;One of the bishops and presbyters
shall be chosen to lay his hand upon his head&rdquo;. Compare
on <a href="#tch9_5">9. 5</a>-8.</p>
<p>In the Constitutions the deacons hold the book of the
Gospels over the person to be consecrated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h3><a id="teh3" href="#tch3">3</a></h3>
<p>The Jewish background of this prayer is extremely
marked, and 2-3 may well have been taken bodily from
some synagogue formula; Christianity is regarded as
the orderly continuation of Old Testament Judaism.</p>
<p>4. &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; (more precisely &ldquo;princely&rdquo;) renders
<span title="h&ecirc;gemonikos" class="g">&#7969;&gamma;&epsilon;&mu;&omicron;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&#8057;&sigmaf;</span>,
taken from the Septuagint version of Psalm 51. 12 (50. 14).</p>
<p>The Epitome&rsquo;s abbreviation in this passage avoids
suggesting that until a definite moment the Son did not
possess the Spirit (Connolly, p. 151). The unabbreviated
text is practically only a combination of Matthew
3. 16 and John 20. 22, but the result is so definitely anti-modalistic
that it is probably the work of Hippolytus;
the language is over-precise for a prayer.</p>
<p>5. &ldquo;Thou who knowest the hearts of all&rdquo; is from
Acts 1. 24, but such exact Scriptural language is more
characteristic of the fourth century than the third.
While the emphasis is on the bishop&rsquo;s offering the
&ldquo;gifts&rdquo;, his prayers for his flock are certainly not excluded
as part of his high-priestly ministry (Hebrews
7. 25, etc.).</p>
<p>6. The &ldquo;odour of sweet savour&rdquo; is the offering of a
holy life, as in Romans 12. 1.</p>
<p><a id="n3_7">7.</a> The doxology is that given in the Epitome and
presupposed in the Canons and Testament, with the
substitution of &ldquo;through whom&rdquo; (so the other sources)
for &ldquo;with whom&rdquo; (a peculiarity of the Epitomist).
After &ldquo;honour&rdquo; the Latin and Ethiopic insert &ldquo;to the
Father and the Son&rdquo;. &ldquo;Servant&rdquo; as a liturgical title
for Christ comes from Acts 4. 27, 30; the later versions
naturally substitute &ldquo;Son&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Sahidic and the Arabic omit the consecration
prayer entirely, presumably because it did not accord
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
with local use. The Canons paraphrase Hippolytus&rsquo;s
form slightly; the Constitutions and the Testament enlarge
it greatly. For the sake of comparison Sarapion&rsquo;s
prayer may be given:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="fl">Thou</span> who didst send the Lord Jesus for the gain of
the whole world, thou who didst through him choose
the apostles, thou who generation by generation didst
ordain holy bishops, O God of truth, make this bishop
also a living bishop, worthy (?) of the succession of the
holy apostles, and give to him grace and divine Spirit,
that thou didst freely give to all thine own servants and
prophets and patriarchs: make him to be worthy to
shepherd thy flock, and let him still continue unblamably
and unoffendingly in the bishopric.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be observed that here the references to the Old
Testament are almost non-existent and that there is no
mention of high-priestly functions.</p>
<h3>4-6
<br />THE EUCHARIST</h3>
<p>Fundamental for any comprehension of the first liturgical
history of the eucharist is the fact that among
Jews a &ldquo;blessing&rdquo; of food is without exception a
&ldquo;thanksgiving&rdquo;; a Jew never says &ldquo;Bless this food&rdquo;, but
always &ldquo;Blessed be God&rdquo;. So in the New Testament,
when such a blessing is in question,
<span title="euchariste&ocirc;" class="g">&epsilon;&#8016;&chi;&alpha;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#8051;&omega;</span>
and
<span title="euloge&ocirc;" class="g">&epsilon;&#8016;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&#8051;&omega;</span>
are used without distinction; compare, e.g., Mark 8. 6-7.</p>
<p>The various Jewish blessings in their oldest literary
forms are collected in the Mishnah tractate <i>Berakhoth</i>;<a class="fn" id="fr_166" href="#fn_166">[166]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
this was finally compiled in the third century, but most
of its contents are much earlier; note in chapter 8 the
account of the pre-Christian controversy between the
schools of Hillel and Shammai. The form of all the
blessings is the same; after the opening words of praise
the worshipper recites the particular act of God for
which thanksgiving is due. So over bread the formula is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="fl">Blessed</span> be thou, O God, King of the universe, who
hast brought forth bread from the ground;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and over wine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="fl">Blessed</span> be thou, O God, King of the universe, who
hast created the fruit of the vine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no real reason to doubt that these were the
words used by Christ at the Last Supper when he &ldquo;gave
thanks&rdquo;; Mark 14. 25 takes up the blessing used over
the cup.</p>
<p>To eat without thanksgiving was a sin, and he who
did so at least violated God&rsquo;s law commanding thankfulness.
But most Jews would also have held that
unblessed food is unfit for consumption, and that pronouncing
the benediction removes this quasi-uncleanness,
i.e., &ldquo;hallows&rdquo; it: &ldquo;Nothing is to be rejected, if
it be received with thanksgiving; for it is sanctified
through the word of God<a class="fn" id="fr_167" href="#fn_167">[167]</a> and prayer&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_168" href="#fn_168">[168]</a> In other
words, the act of thanksgiving was construed as having
a consecratory effect, potent even for ordinary food and
therefore especially potent for sacred food. So St Paul
writes in 1 Corinthians 10. 16: &ldquo;The cup of thanksgiving
over which we give thanks, is it not a communion
of the blood of Christ?&rdquo; In Hippolytus the
same conception appears unambiguously in <a href="#tch21_6">21. 6</a> and
<a href="#tch23">23</a>, but it also underlies his use of &ldquo;thanksgiving&rdquo; in
<a href="#tch4_2">4. 2</a> and <a href="#tch10_4">10. 4</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Accordingly, since at the Christians&rsquo; greatest liturgical
service the essential formula was a solemn thanksgiving,
the service itself and food consecrated at the
service both came to be called simply &ldquo;The Thanksgiving&rdquo;
or (in Greek) &ldquo;The Eucharist&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_169" href="#fn_169">[169]</a> And&mdash;certainly
in the second century, since Hippolytus gives the
formula&mdash;the eucharistic prayer was prefaced by the
invitatory, &ldquo;Let us make our thanksgiving to the Lord&rdquo;,
and this in turn by the appropriate words, &ldquo;Lift up
your hearts&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Since extempore prayer was still largely practised
(<a href="#tch10">4</a>), the contents of the Christian thanksgivings naturally
varied widely, but it would appear inevitable that
at first, in accord with Christ&rsquo;s example, God&rsquo;s provision
of food for men was the normal topic: the beautiful
prayer in the Didache is formed on this model, which
Hippolytus follows closely in <a href="#tch5">chapters 5-6</a>. But the
thought of food in the bread and wine was overshadowed
by the thought of redemption, and even in
the Didache the earthly species only typify the salvation
wrought in Christ. In <a href="#tch4">chapter 4</a> of Hippolytus the
&ldquo;table&rdquo; form of the blessing is abandoned altogether
for the praise of Christ&rsquo;s redeeming works, and the same
is true of practically all later liturgies. As is entirely
natural, Hippolytus&rsquo;s thanksgiving concludes with reciting
the work of Christ most vividly in mind at the
moment: his institution of the rite that the church was
engaged in celebrating.<a class="fn" id="fr_170" href="#fn_170">[170]</a></p>
<p>The evidence of the later liturgies shows us that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
purely Christian objects of thanksgiving in Hippolytus
were by no means the only ones for which God was
blessed; thanks could be given with entire appropriateness
to the Father for any of His benefits from creation
on. For such prayers Jewish synagogue formulas provided
models that were freely utilized; compare, e.g.,
Constitutions <span class="small">VII</span>, 33-38. These thanksgivings often included
(<span class="small">VII</span>, 35, 3) or culminated in the hymn of Isaiah
6. 3 (&ldquo;Sanctus&rdquo;), and in this way this hymn passed into
the Christian eucharistic prayers, to become an all but
universal feature in them. In the liturgy in the Constitutions
it stands at a place that shows its origin, at
the close of the (Jewish) thanksgivings for Old Testament
benefits (<span class="small">VIII</span>, 12, 27) and before the (Christian)
thanksgivings for Christ&rsquo;s incarnate acts.</p>
<p>After the completion of the thanksgiving (4. 10) Hippolytus
makes certain additions. <a href="#tch4_11">4. 11</a> declares that in
performing the rite the church remembers Christ according
to his command: this is the germ of what in the
later liturgies is known as the &ldquo;anamnesis&rdquo;. And the
offering is formally presented to God; this likewise
reoccurs regularly and is called the &ldquo;oblation&rdquo;. Either
or both of these features could have been used in any
eucharistic prayer from the earliest time.</p>
<p>4. 12, however, shows a later concept. In the age of
Hippolytus the consecratory effect of thanksgiving was
growing unfamiliar, and a special petition was thought
needful in order that the bread and wine might truly
be made &ldquo;a communion&rdquo; of the body and blood of
Christ. The liturgy&rsquo;s thought is simple: if earthly food
is truly to become &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; food,<a class="fn" id="fr_171" href="#fn_171">[171]</a> God must send
upon it the Spirit. The prayer is phrased accordingly,
and is the first known instance of what is technically
known as the &ldquo;invocation&rdquo;, universal in Eastern
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
liturgies, although absent from the present Roman. But
the testimony of Irenaeus shows that in the late second
century at Rome the invocation was regarded as the
truly consecratory formula,<a class="fn" id="fr_172" href="#fn_172">[172]</a> and Hippolytus continues
Irenaeus&rsquo; tradition.</p>
<p>Hippolytus&rsquo;s use of the invocation shows that only
bread and wine are offered to God at the oblation. For
his doctrine of communion see on <a href="#tch23_1">23. 1</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="teh4" href="#tch4">4</a></h3>
<p>2. &ldquo;All the presbytery&rdquo; join with the bishop in
offering the gifts; the &ldquo;concelebration&rdquo; of a later
terminology. The custom is derived from a time when
the local monarchical episcopate was not yet established
and the presbyters were normal officiants at worship.<a class="fn" id="fr_173" href="#fn_173">[173]</a>
They act in their corporate capacity; compare on
<a href="#teh8">chapter 8</a>.</p>
<p>4. If 11 is construed strictly, the &ldquo;we&rdquo; of this prayer
should be &ldquo;we, the bishop and presbyters&rdquo;. But the
plural pronoun originally&mdash;and probably in Hippolytus&rsquo;s
opinion also&mdash;meant &ldquo;all we Christians in this
congregation&rdquo;; compare <a href="#tch4_12">4. 12</a>, &ldquo;your sacrifice&rdquo; in
Didache 14 and the explicit language in Justin, Dialogue
116-117. &ldquo;Messenger of thy counsel&rdquo; is from the
Septuagint of Isaiah 9. 6; it recurs in Hippolytus&rsquo;s
Daniel commentary (<span class="small">III</span>, 9, 6) and is used here as an
anti-modalist term.</p>
<p>5. This whole sentence is anti-modalist.</p>
<p>6. As in <a href="#tch3_4">3. 4</a> the language is more theological than
liturgic.</p>
<p>7. Christ&rsquo;s hands were spread out in appeal (Isaiah
65. 2, Lamentations 1. 17).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>8. The &ldquo;boundary post&rdquo; is the Cross, dividing the
realms of life and death.</p>
<p>9. The terms in Christ&rsquo;s words regarding the bread
and the cup are given liturgical balance by introducing
<span title="kl&ocirc;menon" class="g">&kappa;&lambda;&#8061;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&nu;</span>,
&ldquo;which is broken&rdquo;, after &ldquo;body&rdquo;; this
addition found its way into many manuscripts of
1 Corinthians 11. 24.</p>
<p>10. The terseness of this phrase is effective. In the
Latin translator&rsquo;s &ldquo;commemorationem facitis&rdquo; the indicative
is certainly a mistake,<a class="fn" id="fr_174" href="#fn_174">[174]</a>
while his &ldquo;perform a memorial&rdquo; may be merely a Latinistic simplification of
&ldquo;do this in memory of me&rdquo;; the Pseudo-Ambrosian
<i>De Sacramentis</i> has similarly &ldquo;commemorationem facietis&rdquo;
and the present Roman liturgy &ldquo;memoriam facietis&rdquo;.
By what follows the phrase here means &ldquo;recall
to our mind&rdquo;.</p>
<p>11. To &ldquo;death&rdquo; in 1 Corinthians 11. 26 &ldquo;resurrection&rdquo;
has been added; later liturgies at this point
expand freely. Later liturgical development also connected
&ldquo;memory&rdquo; and &ldquo;offer&rdquo; closely, pleading Christ&rsquo;s
death before the Father.</p>
<p>12. The prayer for unity echoes the habitual Jewish
prayers for the return of all Israel to Palestine; compare
the Didache.</p>
<p>13. Compare on <a href="#n3_7">3. 7</a>.</p>
<p>In this prayer as a whole the accumulation of phrases
in <a href="#tch5">5-6</a> is largely due to Hippolytus, who may likewise
be responsible for parts of 7-8. But, even as it stands,
it is noteworthy for its sobriety and directness, both
characteristic of the later Roman liturgy until Gallican
floridity affected it.</p>
<p>The liturgical influence of this prayer has been incalculable.
It is the basis of the liturgy in the Constitutions,
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
through which it determined the form and
in part the wording of the great Eastern liturgies,
St James,<a class="fn" id="fr_175" href="#fn_175">[175]</a> St Basil and St Chrysostom. In the other
Eastern rites its influence is usually perceptible, though
less fundamental, while in the Ethiopic church it is still
used almost unchanged. In the West, however, later
eucharistic conceptions led to a different type of liturgy.</p>
<p>Hippolytus gives only the vital part of the ceremony,
which otherwise was presumably much as it is described
in Justin, <i>Apology</i> 67. But perhaps at a consecration
service the opening lessons and instruction were omitted.</p>
<h3><a id="teh5" href="#tch5">5</a>-6</h3>
<p>This blessing at the eucharist of food other than the
bread and wine is a remnant of the primitive custom
when the rite included a meal; in Hippolytus&rsquo;s day,
presumably, the cheese and olives were eaten at the
service and part of the oil was sipped, the remainder
being reserved for anointing the sick.<a class="fn" id="fr_176" href="#fn_176">[176]</a> Perhaps only
Hippolytus&rsquo;s exaggerated reverence for the past preserved
the usage, which at any rate soon disappeared.
None of the other versions of his treatise retain
<a href="#tch6">chapter 6</a>, for which the Canons<a class="fn" id="fr_177" href="#fn_177">[177]</a> substitute a blessing of first-fruits.
In the Testament the oil is blessed solely for the
sick,<a class="fn" id="fr_178" href="#fn_178">[178]</a> and this is probably the conception in the Ethiopic
and the Canons. The Sahidic and Arabic replace all of
<a href="#tch4">4-6</a> with a note that the bishop should follow &ldquo;the
(local) custom&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The usual Old Testament background to these
prayers need hardly be pointed out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The prayer at the blessing of the oil has real affinities
with the prayer still used in the Roman church for
blessing the &ldquo;oil of the sick&rdquo; at the bishop&rsquo;s Maundy
Thursday eucharist.</p>
<h3><a id="teh6" href="#tch6">6</a></h3>
<p>2. This ingeniously worded prayer has no parallel.</p>
<p>3. Compare Zechariah 4. 12.</p>
<p>4. Compare the Jewish use of fixed <i>initial</i> clauses in
benedictions.</p>
<h3><a id="teh8" href="#tch8">8</a>
<br />PRESBYTERS</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Presbyter&rdquo; is a technical term in Judaism, which early
Christianity took over.<a class="fn" id="fr_179" href="#fn_179">[179]</a> The Jewish conceptions at the
beginning of the Christian era are best seen in the
Mishnah tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>:<a class="fn" id="fr_180" href="#fn_180">[180]</a> the presbyters, in virtue of
their divinely instituted office (Exodus 24. 9), preserved,
interpreted and applied the received tradition of God&rsquo;s
revelation, and so were the divinely appointed rulers of
Israel. In consequence, every Jewish community, even
the smallest, had its
presbytery,<a class="fn" id="fr_181" href="#fn_181">[181]</a> which exercised all
local governmental functions. When a vacancy occurred,
the presbytery elected a new member; if he had served
as a presbyter elsewhere, he was simply caused to &ldquo;take
his seat&rdquo;; if not, the presbytery ordained him by the
imposition of hands. Individual presbyters had no
authority, which was possessed solely by the body as a
whole; this principle was maintained so rigorously that
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
there were not even regular presiding officers.<a class="fn" id="fr_182" href="#fn_182">[182]</a> If a
priest was elected as a presbyter, he was ordained like
anyone else.<a class="fn" id="fr_183" href="#fn_183">[183]</a> The same seems to have been true of the
Rabbis<a class="fn" id="fr_184" href="#fn_184">[184]</a> before <span class="small">A.D.</span> 70; after that year they took over
what was left of the presbyters&rsquo; duties and were always
ordained.</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind that the Jewish presbyters
were community officers, not cult officials. They could
determine how worship should be conducted, but as
presbyters they had no special share in conducting it:
this was the equal privilege of all male Israelites.<a class="fn" id="fr_185" href="#fn_185">[185]</a> In
particular, while the presbyters, among their other
duties, administered the affairs of the local synagogue,
to define them as &ldquo;elders of the synagogue&rdquo; is totally
to misunderstand them.</p>
<p>The introduction of the presbyterial system into
Christianity offers a complicated problem, into which
it is unnecessary to enter here. It is enough to note that
in the New Testament when the office is fully developed&mdash;as
in Acts and the Pastoral Epistles&mdash;the Jewish
analogies are evident. In Hippolytus&rsquo;s ordination
prayer the Jewish origin is explicitly recognized; so much
so that the institution of the office is attributed to Moses,
whose seventy elders possessed the same gifts and functions
as their Christian namesakes. Accordingly the essential
duties of a presbyter are simply to &ldquo;sustain and govern&rdquo;,<a class="fn" id="fr_186" href="#fn_186">[186]</a>
and no other specific gifts are prayed for. So it is really
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
conceivable that Hippolytus&rsquo;s formula reproduces the
substance of a Jewish ordination prayer.</p>
<p>In Christianity, however, the most important service
was a feast in which the whole community joined, while
in Judaism the (numerous) sacral meals were held by
each family separately.<a class="fn" id="fr_187" href="#fn_187">[187]</a> Hence the Christian presbyters
could be called on for duties unlike those of the Jewish
officials; as the leaders of the community they might
well appear as the leaders of the community&rsquo;s feast. And
in fact, as the &ldquo;charismatic&rdquo; prophets, teachers, etc.,
gradually disappeared, the presbyters became the
normal officiants at the eucharist.<a class="fn" id="fr_188" href="#fn_188">[188]</a> So it was only a
question of time until they acquired sacerdotal titles;
compare <a href="#tch9_2">9. 2</a> in our treatise.</p>
<p>The introduction of the local monarchical episcopate
transformed the presbytery from the ruling body into a
mere council of advice for the bishop, and so reduced
radically the importance of its members. They had a
voice in disciplinary affairs, and they clung tenaciously
to their share in offering the eucharist and in the ordination
of a new member to their ranks. Otherwise during
the late second and third centuries their duties<a class="fn" id="fr_189" href="#fn_189">[189]</a> might
be little more than honorary, and in most communities<a class="fn" id="fr_190" href="#fn_190">[190]</a>
the presbyters probably devoted their weekdays to
secular occupations; in contrast to the bishop and the
deacons.</p>
<p>1. In 1 Timothy 4. 14, as in Judaism, ordination is
by the presbytery. A different conception appears in
2 Timothy 1. 6, and harmonization of the two produced
ordination by the bishop <i>and</i> the presbytery, the practice
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
still maintained in the Roman and Anglican Communions.
For Hippolytus&rsquo;s theory compare <a href="#tch9_4">9. 4</a>-8.</p>
<p>2. The verbs &ldquo;sustain and govern&rdquo; are the cognates
of the nouns translated &ldquo;helps, governments&rdquo; in
1 Corinthians 12. 28. But in 1 Corinthians <i>two</i> offices
are meant.</p>
<p>3. Compare Exodus 24. 9-11. That these elders were
&ldquo;filled with the Spirit&rdquo; is from Numbers 11. 25, but the
specific mention of this in an ordination prayer seems
Christian rather than Jewish.</p>
<p>4. The bishop here includes himself with the presbytery,
perhaps a survival of a form used in pre-episcopal
days.</p>
<p>In the Ethiopic this prayer is reproduced almost
unchanged. The Epitome has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="fl">Almighty lord</span>, who through Christ hast created
all things and through him hast foreseen all things;
look even now upon thy holy church, and give it increase,
and multiply its rulers, and grant them might
to labour with word and work for the building up of
thy people. And now look upon this thy servant, who
by the voice and judgment of all the clergy is chosen for
the presbytery, and fill him with the Spirit of grace and
counsel, that he may sustain and govern thy people
with a pure heart&mdash;as thou didst look upon thy chosen
people and didst command Moses that he should choose
presbyters, whom thou didst fill with the Spirit&mdash;that
he, being filled with powers of healing and words of
teaching in meekness, may diligently instruct this thy
people with a pure mind and a willing soul, and may
blamelessly complete the ministrations for thy people.
Through thy Christ, with whom be to thee glory and
worship, with the Holy Spirit, world without end.
Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>This prayer is evidently Hippolytus&rsquo;s, somewhat enlarged
and slightly revised, and the only real difference
is that the bishop no longer associates himself with
the presbytery. The Constitutions merely expand the
Epitome&rsquo;s prayer still further with a recital of God&rsquo;s
attributes. In the Testament there is an independent
expansion of Hippolytus&rsquo;s form, but again without
significant variations. Sarapion has still another paraphrase,
but one equally centred about the presbyter&rsquo;s
teaching office.</p>
<p>The Sahidic and the Arabic, however, provide that
the prayer used for the consecration of a bishop shall
also be used at the ordination of a presbyter. With this
the Canons agree, reading: &ldquo;When a presbyter is
ordained, let all things take place for him as take place
for the bishop, with the exception of the word &lsquo;bishop&rsquo;.
The bishop is in every regard like the presbyter, apart
from the throne and the ordination, for to the latter no
power to ordain is given&rdquo;. This evidence is in accord
with the well-known fact that the introduction of the
monarchical episcopate came later in Egypt than
elsewhere.</p>
<h3><a id="teh9" href="#tch9">9</a>
<br />DEACONS</h3>
<p>The development of the diaconate in the first century
is extremely obscure, but in the Pastoral Epistles and
1 Clement &ldquo;presbyters&rdquo; are divided into &ldquo;bishops and
deacons&rdquo;&mdash;in these works the three terms are never used
together&mdash;indicating specializations within the presbyterate.
Some presbyters were especially concerned in
&ldquo;overseeing&rdquo; the community and others with &ldquo;serving&rdquo;
it&mdash;particularly in charitable works; compare the
&ldquo;governments&rdquo; and &ldquo;helps&rdquo; in 1 Corinthians 12. 28.
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
When monarchical episcopacy was introduced, the now
more or less supernumerary &ldquo;overseers&rdquo; were less important
than the &ldquo;servers&rdquo;, who became the personal
assistants of the bishops. The respective status in the
third century is set forth in Didascalia, chapter 9
(= Constitutions <span class="small">II</span>, 26, 4-7): &ldquo;Let the bishop ... be
honoured by you as God.... The deacon is with you as a
type of Christ, so let him be loved by you. Let the
deaconess be honoured by you as a type of the Holy
Spirit. Let the presbyters be looked on by you as a type
of the apostles&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="tb">1. The reference is apparently to <a href="#tch2">chapter 2</a>, with no
explanation how choice by the people is reconciled with
<a href="#tch3_6">3. 6</a>. The Sahidic, the Testament and the Canons agree
with the Latin, but the Arabic, Ethiopic and the Constitutions
speak only of the bishop. But the close relations
between the bishop and the deacons would seem
to make his freedom of choice necessary.</p>
<p>Does the absence of any provision for election in
<a href="#tch8">chapter 8</a> indicate that the presbyters were still chosen
by the presbytery?</p>
<p>2-4. Any (surviving?) remnant of the conception of
deacons as &ldquo;serving presbyters&rdquo; is dismissed summarily.</p>
<p>5-8. Hippolytus is attempting to reconcile a ceremonial
survival of the days when presbyters ordained
with the doctrine that ordination is the prerogative of
bishops. The result is incoherent; if a presbyter has no
power to &ldquo;give&rdquo;, what is said of the &ldquo;common and like
Spirit&rdquo; is pointless. And, although the passage appears
intact (or expanded) in the other versions, 7-8 read like
a later addition. But perhaps these are a theory of
Hippolytus&rsquo;s, glossed on a traditional phrase.</p>
<p>10-12. The original text of this passage is very uncertain.
The Latin breaks off with &ldquo;offere&rdquo;, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
following words in the Ethiopic and the Testament
stress what in Hippolytus is a minor and not characteristic
function of the deacons (<a href="#tch4_2">4. 2</a>), while their chief
duties are ignored. Moreover, neither the Constitutions,
the Canons nor Sarapion have anything corresponding;
all three&mdash;in widely different terms&mdash;petition for &ldquo;faithfulness&rdquo;
and &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo;; all three, incidentally, quote
<span class="scripRef">Acts 6</span>. It is worth noting that none of the sources call
the deacons &ldquo;Levites&rdquo;; this title<a class="fn" id="fr_191" href="#fn_191">[191]</a> appears to come in
a later age when&mdash;through the change from local to
diocesan episcopacy&mdash;the deacons became the assistants
of the presbyters.</p>
<p>The Ethiopic<a class="fn" id="fr_192" href="#fn_192">[192]</a>
and the Constitutions speak of the
diaconate as a preparation for the presbyterate: this
conception belongs to the fourth, not the third, century.</p>
<h3><a id="teh10" href="#tch10">10</a>
<br />CONFESSORS</h3>
<p>1. A true confessor is, <i>ipso facto</i>, a presbyter. This
declaration&mdash;which other conceptions have altered in
the Ethiopic and the Constitutions&mdash;follows logically
from the original definition of a presbyter&rsquo;s duties: since
his primary function is to bear witness to the truth, and
since no witness can be more impressively borne than
when in danger of death, a confessor proves that he has
the Spirit of the presbyterate. Hence ordination would
be otiose.</p>
<p>A still earlier theory is that set forth in Hermas,
<i>Visions</i> III, i, where the correct ranks of those who
occupy the &ldquo;bench&rdquo; (of the clergy) is given as
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
&ldquo;confessors,<a class="fn" id="fr_193" href="#fn_193">[193]</a> prophets, presbyters&rdquo;, as three distinct orders;
in Hippolytus the prophets disappear and the confessors
are merged with the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; presbyters.</p>
<p>In the third century, as confessors multiplied, observance
of this rule would have overloaded the presbyterate
to an impracticable degree,<a class="fn" id="fr_194" href="#fn_194">[194]</a> although in the
small community of Hippolytus the difficulty would not
be felt and the traditional practice could be maintained
inviolate. But elsewhere the modification in Constitutions
<span class="small">VIII</span>, 23 was no doubt widely accepted: the
office of a confessor was one of great dignity,<a class="fn" id="fr_195" href="#fn_195">[195]</a> but it did
not include its holder among the clergy.<a class="fn" id="fr_196" href="#fn_196">[196]</a>
The Ethiopic compromises: a confessor is not yet a presbyter, but can
claim episcopal ordination to the presbyterate as a right.</p>
<p>2. Hippolytus treats these &ldquo;minor&rdquo; confessors as the
Constitutions treat the true confessors. The other
sources (except the Constitutions) deal with them more
generously. In the Ethiopic they can <i>claim</i> ordination
to the diaconate, in the Arabic and the Canons to the
presbyterate, in the Sahidic to any office of which they
are worthy; compare the Testament.</p>
<p>The Canons have a curious provision for a confessor
who is a slave (and therefore incapable of receiving
ordination); such a one is &ldquo;a presbyter for the congregation&rdquo;,
even though he does not receive &ldquo;the insignia of
the presbyterate&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<h3>CONCLUSION OF ORDINAL</h3>
<p>3. &ldquo;At every ordination the eucharist must be
offered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4. Compare Justin, <i>Apology</i> 67, where the &ldquo;president&rdquo;
offers prayers &ldquo;according to his ability&rdquo;
(<span title="hos&ecirc; dynamis aut&ocirc;" class="g">&#8005;&sigma;&eta; &delta;&#8059;&nu;&alpha;&mu;&iota;&sigmaf; &alpha;&#8016;&tau;&#8183;</span>),
and Tertullian, <i>Apology</i> 30: &ldquo;we pray ...
without a monitor, for our prayers are from the heart&rdquo;.
But extempore prayer in no way excludes frequent use
of traditional formulas.</p>
<h3>11-15
<br />MINOR ORDERS</h3>
<p>In the major orders an endowment of the Spirit is
sought by the imposition of hands; in the minor orders
persons are officially admitted to the exercise of gifts
that they already possess.</p>
<h3><a id="teh11" href="#tch11">11</a></h3>
<p>2-3. The eventual source is 1 Timothy 5. 1-16.</p>
<p>4-5. In 1 Timothy the widows engage both in
prayer (verse 5) and in active work (verse 10). In the
Didascalia and Constitutions these duties are divided:
prayer is the sole task of the &ldquo;widows&rdquo;, while those to
whom the active work is committed are called &ldquo;deaconesses&rdquo;.
The latter, except that they have no part in the
liturgy, correspond in all respects to the deacons, and so
naturally receive an ordination, while the &ldquo;widows&rdquo;
are merely &ldquo;named&rdquo;. So, before the distinction was
established, ordination of (all?) widows was presumably
fairly usual; otherwise the vigour of Hippolytus&rsquo;s protest
is difficult to explain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>In Rome, unlike Syria, active church work by women
was discountenanced and the deaconesses did not make
their appearance. On the general subject of women&rsquo;s
work the Didascalia is a mine of information.</p>
<h3><a id="teh12" href="#tch12">12</a></h3>
<p>Men who could read easily and clearly from a manuscript
were not too common, so that the reader had a
position of some dignity. The Constitutions, in fact,
make a major order of the office and the prayer (<span class="small">VIII</span>, 22)
beseeches &ldquo;the prophetic Spirit&rdquo;, suggesting that
readers were expected to give some exposition and
teaching. Both the Constitutions and the Testament
treat readership as a step toward higher advancement.
In the Sahidic the reader is given St Paul&rsquo;s Epistles;
Schwartz (p. 32) thinks this is original.</p>
<h3><a id="teh13" href="#tch13">13</a></h3>
<p>For the development of the status of virgins in the
church reference must be made to the special literature.
Hippolytus, in marked contrast to the Testament, dismisses
the subject very briefly and refers to virgins again
only in <a href="#tch25_1">25. 1</a>, although this brevity of treatment in a
law book does not prove lack of practical interest in the
subject. As the &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; was publicly announced, it
corresponded to the later formal vow.</p>
<h3><a id="teh14" href="#tch14">14</a></h3>
<p>The account in Acts 6 was generally interpreted as
limiting the number of deacons in any place to seven,
far too few for effective service in large churches. So
each deacon was given an assistant to &ldquo;serve&rdquo; him;
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
compare <a href="#tch30">chapter 30</a>. But even this was inadequate in
very large communities, and at Rome <i>ca.</i> 250 the seven
deacons and their subdeacons were further assisted by
forty-two acolytes (&ldquo;followers&rdquo;).<a class="fn" id="fr_197" href="#fn_197">[197]</a> The subdiaconate
eventually became a major order and it is so treated in
the Constitutions and the Testament.</p>
<h3><a id="teh15" href="#tch15">15</a></h3>
<p>The gift of healing (1 Corinthians 12. 28, etc.) was the
only one of the primitive charismatic gifts to survive
into the third century in its original form, and in Hippolytus
its purely charismatic nature is still recognized;
not only is there no ordination but the healer is not
even &ldquo;named&rdquo;. But healers in the specialized form of
&ldquo;exorcists&rdquo; form a minor order in Rome a generation
later.<a class="fn" id="fr_198" href="#fn_198">[198]</a> One of their most important functions was to
assist in preparing catechumens for baptism; compare
<a href="#tch20_3">20. 3</a>.</p>
<h3>PART II
<br />Baptism</h3>
<h3>16-20
<br />CATECHUMENS</h3>
<p>In the apostolic age converts were accepted with little
question and were baptized immediately on profession
of faith;<a class="fn" id="fr_199" href="#fn_199">[199]</a> the missionary zeal of the new religion,
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
heightened by the expectation of the end of the world,
sought only to compel men to come in. Naturally this
enthusiasm was always tempered with common sense&mdash;no
teacher could have baptized every applicant&mdash;but
the doors were opened wide, and the New Testament
gives no hint of any formal training before reception.
The hope that defects would be made up by Christian
grace was doubtless fulfilled to a surprising degree, but
it was also often grievously disappointed: men were
admitted into Christianity who neither understood its
teachings nor desired to follow them, and it was from
this class that Gnosticism and other vagaries drew their
recruits. The account in Acts 8. 18-24 is typical.</p>
<p>The result was a violent reaction that made entry into
the church extremely difficult, and no one was permitted
baptism until he had passed through a long and
searching probation called the &ldquo;catechumenate&rdquo;. As it
appears fully developed in the early third century, it
must reach far back into the second or perhaps even
into the first.</p>
<h3><a id="teh16" href="#tch16">16</a></h3>
<p>1. &ldquo;Hearers&rdquo; is perhaps used here in its later
technical sense as a title for catechumens in their first
stage. In Hippolytus the &ldquo;word&rdquo; that they are permitted
to hear does not include the Gospel (<a href="#tch20_2">20. 2</a>);
elsewhere they were allowed to remain at the Sunday
service until all the liturgical lessons had been read and
the sermon had been preached. The &ldquo;teachers&rdquo; were
those employed in the instruction of the catechumens;
they were not necessarily clerics (<a href="#tch19_1">19. 1</a>) and did not
form a special class.</p>
<p>2-24. The reason for most of these rules is self-evident.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>13. Greek education included much time spent on
Homer, whose mythology the Christians naturally regarded
as unedifying. But the permission given to
schoolmasters to continue their calling in case of necessity
shows that no one took the Homeric deities very
seriously.</p>
<p>17. In many cases soldiers were utilized only for
police duty, but Christian soldiers were always in danger
of being given tasks inconsistent with their religion.
Hippolytus probably does not consider the rather infrequent
possibility of soldiers being sent to defend the
frontiers against barbarians. The &ldquo;oath&rdquo; invoked
heathen deities.</p>
<p>18. Judges and military officers were constantly
called on to pronounce and inflict capital punishment.
They were also inextricably involved in the support of
emperor-worship.</p>
<p>19. A man who was already a soldier could be accepted
under the conditions of 17. But no believer was permitted
voluntarily to expose himself to such temptations.</p>
<p>23. Since the woman in such a case had no power to
alter her condition, Hippolytus&rsquo;s rule is sensible and
humane.</p>
<p>24. Men, who could control their conduct, were
granted no such concession.</p>
<p>25. A remnant of the older charismatic teaching;
Compare <a href="#tch38_4">38. 4</a>. It is conjoined somewhat oddly with
these detailed legalistic prescriptions; the right to judge
spiritually may be exercised only where the law is not
explicit. And only the clergy exercise the gift.</p>
<h3><a id="teh17" href="#tch17">17</a></h3>
<p>A three years catechumenate has parallels in later
practice, but it represents about the maximum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<h3><a id="teh18" href="#tch18">18</a></h3>
<p>1. Separation of catechumens from believers and
men from women was carried out rigorously throughout
the Patristic age.</p>
<p>3-4. Contrast <a href="#tch22_6">22. 6</a>. The kiss of peace marked the
close of the service that preceded the eucharist (e.g.,
Constitutions <span class="small">VIII</span>, 11, 9).</p>
<p>5. 1 Corinthians 11. 10.</p>
<h3><a id="teh19" href="#tch19">19</a></h3>
<p>1. The imposition of hands was partly in blessing,
partly in exorcism (<a href="#tch20_3">20. 3</a>). In later days the first of
these impositions was regarded as the formal admission
to the catechumenate.</p>
<p>2. A universal Patristic teaching.</p>
<h3><a id="teh20" href="#tch20">20</a></h3>
<p>2. Hippolytus knows only two classes of catechumens,
the hearers and those &ldquo;set apart&rdquo;. Subsequently the
latter were called &ldquo;elect&rdquo;, &ldquo;competent&rdquo; or &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo;,
and an intermediate class (&ldquo;kneelers&rdquo;) was
introduced. Hippolytus says nothing about the duration
of this last stage, but four to six or more weeks is
later common.</p>
<p>3. Exorcism before baptism was universally practised
and has survived in some form or other in practically
all the traditional baptismal liturgies. It lacks
New Testament precedent, but is based on the dualism
found in <span class="scripRef">John 14. 30</span>, etc., according to which this
world&mdash;and so all its unregenerate inhabitants&mdash;is
under the sway of Satan and his angels. In Hippolytus&rsquo;s
community the exorcisms were presumably performed
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
by the teachers, as he does not recognize exorcists as a
separate class (compare on <a href="#teh15">chapter 15</a>).</p>
<p>4. The text of the last clause is so uncertain that the
meaning of the whole is dubious. The Testament, however,
asserts that the episcopal exorcism is bound to
make an unworthy candidate betray himself, and there
is no reason to doubt that Hippolytus believed the same.</p>
<p>5. The final selection and instruction took place on
the Thursday before Easter. &ldquo;Bathing&rdquo; was done in a
public bath-house, with a supplementary &ldquo;washing&rdquo;
at home; compare John 13. 10.</p>
<p>6. Most religions, as well as Judaism, regarded a
menstruous woman as unclean.</p>
<p>7. All believers fasted on Good Friday (<a href="#tch29_1">29. 1</a>); for
the catechumens the fast was probably thought to be
purifying.</p>
<p>8. The Testament gives a lengthy form for this last
pre-baptismal exorcism. Popular belief in the life-giving
power of breath (Genesis 2. 7, etc.) was very
widespread; compare <a href="#tch36_11">36. 11</a>. Mark 7. 34 may have
been specially in mind.<a class="fn" id="fr_200" href="#fn_200">[200]</a> The &ldquo;seal&rdquo; was the sign of
the cross. Compare <a href="#tch37">chapter 37</a>.</p>
<p>9. No further opportunity was given to contract
defilement.</p>
<p>10. This direction, misunderstood in the Arabic and
Ethiopic, is explained by <a href="#tch23_1">23. 1</a>-2. Those about to be
baptized brought with them as their first Christian
&ldquo;offering&rdquo; the bread, wine, milk and honey needed for
the baptismal eucharist. The Testament reduces this
offering to one loaf from each of them. The rule should
not be explained from <a href="#tch32">chapter 32</a>, which is not by
Hippolytus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<h3><a id="teh21" href="#tch21">21</a>
<br />THE BAPTISMAL CEREMONY</h3>
<p>1. Hippolytus gives no form for the blessing of the
water, but the Constitutions (<span class="small">VII</span>, 43) direct an elaborate
thanksgiving, concluding with the words &ldquo;Sanctify this
water and give it grace and power&rdquo;, etc. Clement of
Alexandria (<i>Pedagogue</i> <span class="small">I</span>, vi (50, 4)) appears to presuppose
a petition for the descent of the Logos into the
font.</p>
<p>2. The superior sanctity of &ldquo;living&rdquo; water is a
common belief, and the Testament and the Canons
allow no other for baptism. Compare Didache 7. 1.</p>
<p>3. Every non-Jew in the Graeco-Roman world was
so accustomed to the public baths that the baptismal
usage would not suggest the slightest impropriety.</p>
<p>5. To Hippolytus the ornaments as &ldquo;alien&rdquo; carry
contagion. The Jews have a similar prohibition for
women bathing after ceremonial impurity, but the reason
given is that complete contact with the water is prevented.</p>
<p>6. The first mention of anointing in connection with
baptism is in Tertullian, <i>On Baptism</i> 7 (<i>ca.</i> 205). He
explains the practice as derived from the Old Testament
anointing of priests, and in view of 1 Peter 2. 9 and
Revelation 1. 6; 5. 10<a class="fn" id="fr_201" href="#fn_201">[201]</a> this may well express the original
meaning of the ceremony. Or it may have been
thought to convey the gift of the Spirit, as in 1 Samuel
16. 13, or may rest on more general conceptions of
anointing as consecration, or may even be somehow
connected with the title &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; (= &ldquo;The Anointed
One&rdquo;). But, whatever the origin, unction after baptism
is found practically everywhere in Christendom after the
third century.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>In Hippolytus the blessing is still a thanksgiving and
the oil is named accordingly. In the Constitutions
(<span class="small">VII</span>, 44) the formula is petitionary,<a class="fn" id="fr_202" href="#fn_202">[202]</a> and the oil is called
&ldquo;mystical&rdquo;. The common later title for this oil&mdash;to
which other substances, such as balsam, are often added&mdash;is
&ldquo;chrism&rdquo;. The Latin formula for blessing it still
includes a solemn thanksgiving.</p>
<p>7. The anointing before baptism is derived from the
ancient belief in the curative powers of oil, from which
its use in religious healing (Mark 6. 13, James 5. 14)
was developed. To Hippolytus this oil aids in the final
and supreme exorcism, and it is exorcised, not blessed,
and derives its name from its purpose. In later Latin
usage it is called &ldquo;oil of the catechumens&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Constitutions note (<span class="small">VII</span>, 22, 3) that if the oils are
lacking &ldquo;the water is sufficient&rdquo;. And this was the
universal belief.</p>
<p>9. Some form of renunciation of Satan is a feature
in all traditional baptismal liturgies.</p>
<p>10. Cyril of Jerusalem (<i>Catechetical Lectures</i> 20, 3) says
that this anointing is performed &ldquo;from the very hairs of
your head to your feet&rdquo;. By <a href="#tch22_2">22. 2</a> Hippolytus has
probably the same conception.</p>
<p>11. The pronouns are ambiguous and confusing, but
the sense seems to be that the presbyter who performs
the actual baptism stands on the bank of the stream (or
the edge of the font), while the deacon stands in the
water with the candidate, to instruct and assist him.</p>
<p>12-18. In the Jewish rites that require complete immersion
(the baptism of a proselyte, the cleansing of a
woman, etc.) the ceremony is performed entirely by the
person concerned in the presence of a proper witness;
i.e., such a rite is simply an extension of the Old Testament
prescriptions<a class="fn" id="fr_203" href="#fn_203">[203]</a> that certain impurities must be
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
removed by bathing. Early Christianity shared this
conception, and in New Testament Greek the middle
voice is used for the act of baptism in Acts 22. 16,
1 Corinthians 6. 11; 10. 2; compare the reading of D and
Old Latin manuscripts in Luke 3. 7, &ldquo;to be baptized
in his presence&rdquo;. In Hippolytus the presbyter acts to
the extent of laying his hand on the candidate&rsquo;s head,
but he uses no baptismal formula.<a class="fn" id="fr_204" href="#fn_204">[204]</a> In the Jewish rites
the person after immersion utters a benediction; in
Hippolytus each immersion is preceded by a declaration
of belief. In the apostolic church this declaration certainly
had the form &ldquo;Jesus is Lord&rdquo; (Romans 10. 9,
etc.) and there was only one immersion. The additional
confessions of the Father and the Spirit appear in
Didache 7. 1,<a class="fn" id="fr_205" href="#fn_205">[205]</a> and each was presumably accompanied
by the corresponding immersion that Hippolytus directs.</p>
<p>Each of these three confessions was then further expanded,
so producing the various baptismal creeds. The
one in use at Rome in the early fourth century&mdash;the
basis of the later &ldquo;Apostles&rsquo; Creed&rdquo;&mdash;can be reconstructed
accurately from Rufinus&rsquo; <i>Exposition</i>, and agrees
closely with the form in the Latin version of Hippolytus,
the only significant addition being &ldquo;and the forgiveness
of sins&rdquo; near the close. This clause, in fact, seems to be
due eventually to Hippolytus&rsquo;s arch-enemy, Callistus,
to express a doctrine that the former abhorred. On the
other hand, there is some evidence that the official
Roman creed <i>ca.</i> 200 did not contain &ldquo;and the holy
church&rdquo;, on which Hippolytus lays stress (<a href="#tch6_4">6. 4</a>; <a href="#tch23_10">23. 10</a>);
this clause may be his own addition to protest&mdash;against
Callistus&mdash;that the &ldquo;holy&rdquo; church should not contain
sinners. Later Roman Christianity adopted both
phrases with no feeling of incongruity; compare
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
Cyprian&rsquo;s &ldquo;forgiveness of sins through the holy
church&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_206" href="#fn_206">[206]</a></p>
<p>19. This anointing, like the former, presumably
covered the whole body.</p>
<p>20. In the later Patristic church at this point the
newly baptized put on white garments, which they wore
for seven days.</p>
<h3><a id="teh22" href="#tch22">22</a>
<br />CONFIRMATION</h3>
<p>Hippolytus contributes little to clarifying the difficult
subject of confirmation. In Acts 8. 17 and 19. 6 the rite
conveys the gift of the Spirit, but Hippolytus&rsquo;s prayer,
which cites Titus 3. 5, follows the Pauline-Johannine<a class="fn" id="fr_207" href="#fn_207">[207]</a>
doctrine in attributing this gift to baptism, in accord
with the special immersion after confessing the Spirit.
So only grace for service is besought. But, as in Acts,
the essential ceremony is the imposition of hands, so
that the anointing and the sign of the cross are only
supplementary rites. Curiously enough, however, only
the anointing was preserved in both the Latin and the
Orthodox Eastern churches.</p>

<h3><a id="teh23" href="#tch23">23</a>
<br />THE BAPTISMAL EUCHARIST</h3>
<p>Compare the distinction between the baptismal and the
regular eucharist in Justin, <i>Apology</i> 65 and 67 and in
Didache 9-10 and 14.</p>
<p>1. The conception of consecration by thanksgiving is
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
stated so baldly that the Latin (&ldquo;gratias agat panem
quidem in exemplum&rdquo;) is wholly unidiomatic, but in
all probability the prayer normally included an invocation
like that in <a href="#tch4_12">4. 12</a>. Here, in place of the
&ldquo;spiritual food&rdquo; language in <a href="#tch4_12">4. 12</a>, the result of the
consecration is expressed in the terms of the institution.
Yet Hippolytus appears to shrink a little from calling
the species absolutely the body and blood of Christ: the
bread is the &ldquo;image&rdquo;
(<span title="antitypon" class="g">&#7936;&nu;&tau;&#8055;&tau;&upsilon;&pi;&omicron;&nu;</span>)
of the body and the cup the &ldquo;likeness&rdquo;
(<span title="homoiema" class="g">&#8001;&mu;&omicron;&#8055;&epsilon;&mu;&alpha;</span>)
of the blood. The former word is used in the same way by Cyril of Jerusalem
(23, 20; as an adjective) and the latter by Sarapion in
his first oblation before the words of institution; compare
&ldquo;figura&rdquo; in Tertullian, <i>Against Marcion</i> <span class="small">III</span>, 19 and
<span class="small">IV</span>, 40, and the prayer in the Constitutions (<span class="small">VIII</span>, 12, 39)
that the species may be made to &ldquo;appear&rdquo;
(<span title="apophanai" class="g">&#7936;&pi;&omicron;&phi;&#8049;&nu;&alpha;&iota;</span>)
as the body and blood. None of this language, however,
is &ldquo;symbolic&rdquo; in the modern sense; whatever unlikeness
theologians<a class="fn" id="fr_208" href="#fn_208">[208]</a> might feel existed between the symbols and
the things signified was overshadowed by the realistic
connection that existed between them. But in the
earlier Patristic period the deeper nature of this connection
was left unexplored.</p>
<p>2. Tertullian (<i>chaplet</i> 3, <i>Against Marcion</i> <span class="small">I</span>, 14) and
Clement of Alexandria (<i>Pedagogue</i> <span class="small">I</span>, vi (45, 1)) bear
contemporary testimony to the custom of giving new
Christians milk and honey, so the rite must have been
widespread. It is not in the Constitutions or the Testament,
but the other sources have it. And the 24th canon
of the Third Council of Carthage (397) reads: &ldquo;The
first-fruits, namely milk and honey, which are offered
on a most solemn day for the mystery of infants,<a class="fn" id="fr_209" href="#fn_209">[209]</a>
although offered on the altar should have a blessing of
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
their own, that they may be distinguished from the
sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s body and blood&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Clement of Alexandria, like Hippolytus, cites the Old
Testament prophecies of the promised land,<a class="fn" id="fr_210" href="#fn_210">[210]</a> so the
meaning of the rite was to assure the participants of a
share in salvation. But Hippolytus adds a further explanation
of his own; the milk represents Christ&rsquo;s flesh
and the honey his gentleness. The Canons&mdash;possibly
with a misrecollection of Isaiah 7. 15&mdash;interpret the food
as proper for the newly born.</p>
<p>3. The purpose of the water is to extend the baptismal
washing into the inner man; a somewhat pedantic
ceremony that reappears only in the Ethiopic, although
the Testament applies the theory to the water in the
mixed eucharistic chalice.</p>
<p>5. This is the earliest known formula for eucharistic
administration.</p>
<p>7-11. What is most curious about these directions is
that the sacramental wine is not distinguished in
administration from the other two cups; the other versions
correct this.<a class="fn" id="fr_211" href="#fn_211">[211]</a> Perhaps in this ceremony there has
survived something of the tradition in the earliest text
of Luke 22. 19-20, where the whole emphasis is laid on
the bread.</p>
<p>The little four-clause creed is interesting.</p>
<p>12. An admirable little summary of Christian duty.</p>
<p>13. Hippolytus (compare <span class="small">I.</span> 1) refers to some earlier
work or works of his own, possibly <i>Concerning God and the
Resurrection</i>, whose title is listed on his statue.</p>
<p>14. By the &ldquo;white stone&rdquo; (Revelation 2. 17) evidently
something very concrete is implied. This cannot
be any part of the creed, which is recited while baptism
is in progress, and so the Testament&rsquo;s explanation of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
secret as the doctrine of the resurrection<a class="fn" id="fr_212" href="#fn_212">[212]</a> is excluded.
The only other possibility would appear to be the
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, on which Hippolytus is strangely silent.
Christians of this age regarded the Prayer as having an
almost magical efficacy. It was, moreover, allowed to
none but the baptized and was first uttered by Christians
immediately after their baptism,<a class="fn" id="fr_213" href="#fn_213">[213]</a> a custom which
in the light of Romans 8. 15 and Galatians 4. 6 may
actually go back to apostolic times.</p>
<h3>PART III
<br />Church Laws</h3>
<p><a id="teh25" href="#tch25">25</a>. Fasting is here conceived to intensify prayer&rsquo;s
efficacy. The widows and virgins were especially dedicated
to the work of intercession.</p>
<p>The other versions have &ldquo;pray <i>in</i> the church&rdquo;, but
the Greek gives a more primitive impression.</p>
<p>The bishop, on account of the nature of his duties,
was not permitted to vow a fast to last for any set time;
he might, of course, abstain from food informally if he
wished. Good Friday and Holy Saturday (<a href="#tch29">chapter 29</a>)
were the only fixed fast-days, but special fasts for all
might be directed on any special occasion.</p>
<h3><a id="teh26" href="#tch26">26</a>
<br />THE AGAPE</h3>
<p>The agape, or &ldquo;love-feast&rdquo;, was a Christian meal of a
definitely religious character. Since both Tertullian
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
(<i>Apology</i> 39) and Clement of Alexandria (<i>Pedagogue</i> <span class="small">II</span>, i
(4-7)) speak of it as an established Christian custom, its
origin must lie far behind the third century, and the
importance and liturgical colouring given by the
Evangelists to the accounts of the feedings of the multitudes<a class="fn" id="fr_214" href="#fn_214">[214]</a>
are explicable only as reflecting deep first-century
interest in the rite. Its origin in Christianity,
consequently, must be primitive, while the Gospels indicate
that in the apostolic church it was regarded as a
continuation of the (many) meals shared by Christ and
his disciples. The emphasis on the numbers who were
satisfied by the bread and fish, taken together with
Acts 6. 1-3<a class="fn" id="fr_215" href="#fn_215">[215]</a> and the later history of the agape, show that
a primary purpose of these meals was to provide food
for the needy: it is presumably from this aim that the
name &ldquo;love-feast&rdquo; was derived. And the Gospel accounts
indicate that in the agapes Christ was felt to be
acting as head of his household: that he was in some
manner present.</p>
<p>The agape and the eucharist, consequently, were
closely associated; in  1 John 6 the feeding of the multitudes
leads into the elaborate eucharistic discourse. So
Ignatius uses &ldquo;eucharist&rdquo; and &ldquo;agape&rdquo;
as synonyms,<a class="fn" id="fr_216" href="#fn_216">[216]</a>
while &ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;s Supper&rdquo;, the term employed by
St Paul<a class="fn" id="fr_217" href="#fn_217">[217]</a> and later writers generally for the eucharist, is
Hippolytus&rsquo;s title here for the agape. The confusion was
due to the fact that in the first century the eucharist was
generally celebrated in conjunction with an agape;
indeed, in 1 Corinthians 11 it is clear that the Corinthians
were stressing the banquet elements of their
common meals so strongly that their eucharistic aspect
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
had been forgotten.<a class="fn" id="fr_218" href="#fn_218">[218]</a> Hence in Jude 12 the &ldquo;love-feasts&rdquo;
are most naturally understood to be the combined
agape-eucharists.</p>
<p>During the second century the rites were separated,
the eucharist being transferred to the morning, while
the agape normally remained as an evening meal,
although it could of course be held at any hour. But
Hippolytus preserves remnants of the old association;
as regards the eucharist the oil, cheese and olives of
<a href="#tch5">chapters 5</a>-6, as regards the agape the title &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s
Supper&rdquo; and details of the ceremonial.</p>
<p>According to Hippolytus&rsquo;s description the agapes are
meals given by individuals in their own homes; the host
provides the food and invites the guests, who in return
are expected to pray for him. Each person breaks his
own bread and &ldquo;offers&rdquo; his own cup; this is in accord
with the rule in Berakhoth vi. 6 for the less solemn
meals among the Jews: &ldquo;If men sit for a meal, each
shall pronounce the blessing for himself; but if they
recline, one shall pronounce the blessing for them all&rdquo;.
This procedure, moreover, appears to throw light on
the account in 1 Corinthians 11, where the church is
blamed because &ldquo;each taketh before other his own
supper&rdquo; (verse 21) and the remedy prescribed is &ldquo;wait
for one another&rdquo; (verse 33); it is difficult to see how the
Corinthian disorders could have arisen if there were a
single officiant. In Hippolytus orderliness is procured
by the presence of a cleric&mdash;preferably the bishop,
although a deacon will suffice&mdash;who presides over the
supper and begins it by blessing and distributing a loaf
specially named; this ceremony is superadded to a
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
ritual otherwise complete in itself, and appears to be a
local Roman custom.</p>
<p class="tb">1-2. In the earliest Christianity &ldquo;blessing&rdquo; and
&ldquo;thanksgiving&rdquo; were indistinguishable,<a class="fn" id="fr_219" href="#fn_219">[219]</a> but to Hippolytus
they are no longer always synonyms; perhaps the
&ldquo;blessing&rdquo; was accomplished by signing with the cross,
as in the Canons.</p>
<p>After blessing, the bishop breaks the loaf, eats a portion
himself, and distributes the remainder to all the
baptized members of the company: a procedure exactly
like that of the eucharist. In the earlier combined service,
in fact, this bread would have been actually
eucharistic, for which after the separation &ldquo;blessed&rdquo;
bread was substituted to enable the traditional agape
ceremonial to continue with a minimum of external
change. The final separation must have been comparatively
recent, for Hippolytus feels obliged to emphasize
the difference between the two rites; in later
times there was no danger of confusion, and his translators
consequently do not seem to have grasped his
point.</p>
<p>2. The breaking of each one&rsquo;s bread would be accompanied
by a proper benediction.</p>
<p>3. Roughly parallel is Berakhoth vi. 6: &ldquo;If wine is
brought during a meal, each one must pronounce the
blessing for himself&rdquo;.</p>
<p>4. For the distinction between &ldquo;blessing&rdquo; and &ldquo;exorcism&rdquo;
of objects, compare <a href="#tch21_6">21. 6</a>-7. The Arabic and
Ethiopic substitute &ldquo;blessed bread&rdquo;, even for the catechumens.
Whether the catechumens also broke their
&ldquo;own&rdquo; bread is left uncertain. &ldquo;Offer&rdquo; is here a mere
synonym for &ldquo;give thanks&rdquo;, a usage not found in the
other versions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>5. Perhaps the catechumens stood during the agape;
perhaps they ate at a separate table.</p>
<p>6. Each blessing at an agape must include a prayer
for the host, who is thus repaid for his bounty. For
&ldquo;offer&rdquo; the other versions substitute &ldquo;eat&rdquo;, spoiling
the force.</p>
<p>7. From 1 Corinthians 11. 21 to the final abolition
of the agapes in Christianity (in the eighth century?)
there were constant complaints of disorderly conduct at
these meals; Clement of Alexandria (<i>l.c.</i>) for this reason
objects to their name. Hippolytus cites Matthew 5. 13.</p>
<p>8. <span title="apophor&ecirc;ton" class="g">&#7936;&pi;&omicron;&phi;&#8057;&rho;&eta;&tau;&omicron;&nu;</span>
is simply &ldquo;that which is carried away&rdquo;
and is used in its etymological sense; other meanings,
such as the associated &ldquo;a gift given to dinner guests&rdquo;,
are immaterial here. The &ldquo;apoforetum&rdquo; began like the
regular agape with the distribution of the blessed bread
and (presumably) with public benedictions over bread
and wine, but the rest of the meal was eaten at each
one&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>9. The Gospel accounts of the miraculous feedings
lay similar stress on gathering up the fragments.</p>
<p>10. The complete dominance of the meal by the
bishop would seem to make the above warnings against
disorder needless; as Hippolytus pictures it an agape
would have been the reverse of hilarious.</p>
<p>11-12. Compare Ignatius, <i>Smyrnaeans</i> 8. 1: &ldquo;Let that
be counted a genuine<a class="fn" id="fr_220" href="#fn_220">[220]</a> eucharist that is held by the
bishop or by someone to whom he gives permission&rdquo;;
for the last clause as regards the agapes Hippolytus
simply substitutes &ldquo;or one of the clergy&rdquo;. In later
theory only a priest can &ldquo;bless&rdquo;, and any formula that
can be pronounced validly by a deacon can be pronounced
just as &ldquo;validly&rdquo;, although perhaps not
&ldquo;licitly&rdquo;, by a layman. But this distinction between
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
&ldquo;valid&rdquo; and &ldquo;licit&rdquo; would not have been drawn by
Ignatius or Hippolytus; what a Christian cannot do
licitly he cannot do at all. Evidently Hippolytus regards
the blessed bread as of the essence of the agape.</p>
<p>The Testament agrees in general with Hippolytus. In
the Canons the agape becomes a memorial feast
(<span title="anal&ecirc;mpsis" class="g">&#7936;&nu;&#8049;&lambda;&eta;&mu;&psi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>)
for the dead. It is forbidden on Sunday. The
participants first make their communions and then
meet for the meal. The bread distributed is &ldquo;exorcised&rdquo;;<a class="fn" id="fr_221" href="#fn_221">[221]</a>
explained as signed with the cross. The presence of a
cleric&mdash;normally a presbyter&mdash;while desirable does not
seem to be quite essential.</p>
<h3><a id="teh27" href="#tch27">27</a></h3>
<p>The widows were special objects of the church&rsquo;s charity,
but precautions had to be taken lest even they became
disorderly. The &ldquo;existing conditions&rdquo; may refer to persecutions,
but the phrase is more simply understood of
the donor&rsquo;s inability to entertain a large party in his
own home; compare the <i>apoforetum</i>.</p>
<h3><a id="teh28" href="#tch28">28</a></h3>
<p>Hippolytus, like Didache 13. 3, regards the law of
Deuteronomy 18. 4 as binding on Christians; he says
nothing, however, of an obligation to tithe. The Jewish
background of his prayer is evident; compare particularly
Berakhoth vi. 2 &ldquo;through whose word all things
come to pass&rdquo;, and Rabbi Jehudah&rsquo;s formula in vi. 1
&ldquo;who hast created divers fruits&rdquo;. The only Christian
touch is at the end, and the rest of the prayer may have
been taken bodily from a Jewish source.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>The reasons for the distinctions in 6-7 are probably
irrecoverable, but vegetables of the gourd family were
favoured food among ascetics of the gnostic type.
Perhaps Canticles 2. 1 gave the lily and the rose their
privileged status.</p>
<p>In Hippolytus&rsquo;s day these first-fruits constituted the
chief source of support for the clergy. A writer&mdash;probably
Hippolytus himself&mdash;in Eusebius <span class="small">V</span>, 28. 10-12
speaks with detestation of the payment of money salaries
by heretics to their leaders.</p>
<h3><a id="teh29" href="#tch29">29</a></h3>
<p>On Good Friday and Holy Saturday all Christians were
expected to fast according to their ability; a meritorious
act whose credit would be lost if terminated too soon.<a class="fn" id="fr_222" href="#fn_222">[222]</a>
If neglected through ignorance it could be made up
later, but not between Easter and Pentecost, when all
fasting was everywhere forbidden to orthodox Christians.
It may be observed that Hippolytus&rsquo;s conception
of the repeal of the &ldquo;ancient law&rdquo; extends only to the
particular date set by Numbers 9. 11; otherwise it is
still fully binding. Compare Didache 8. 1.</p>
<p>This fast, it should be noted, is directed only before
the Easter communion; later writers, like the Testament,
treat the breach of a fast (from midnight, generally)
before any communion as a mortal sin. Compare,
further, <a href="#tch32">chapter 32</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="teh30" href="#tch30">30</a></h3>
<p>Hippolytus presupposes a congregation still small
enough to enable the bishop to visit the sick personally,
but large enough to make his visit a great event to the
sick person.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<h3><a id="teh33" href="#tch33">33</a></h3>
<p>This daily session of the presbyters was the Christian
&ldquo;sanhedrin&rdquo;, to which individuals brought their problems
and controversies for &ldquo;instruction&rdquo;. At these
gatherings, in addition, the clergy received assignments
for their duties of that day; in these latter the deacons
were more important than the presbyters and their
absence a more serious fault.</p>
<h3><a id="teh34" href="#tch34">34</a></h3>
<p>Callistus is commemorated by the Roman catacombs
that still bear his name; probably dissatisfaction with
his rival&rsquo;s regulations led Hippolytus to treat this rather
specialized subject. The other versions miss the point
of the &ldquo;tiles&rdquo;&mdash;on which compare Connolly, pp. 116-119&mdash;and
adapt the rules to local burial customs; the
Testament, for instance, discusses embalming.</p>
<h3>PART IV
<br />Lay Devotions</h3>
<p>The devotional life of a layman is centred around the
declaration of Psalm 119. 164, &ldquo;Seven times a day do I
praise thee&rdquo;, at rising, at the third, sixth and ninth
hours, at bedtime, at midnight and at cockcrow. This
distribution corresponds approximately to the later
&ldquo;canonical hours&rdquo;, but in Hippolytus&rsquo;s day these
prayers were still wholly private.</p>
<h3><a id="teh35" href="#tch35">35</a></h3>
<p>1. Following the general&mdash;especially Jewish&mdash;belief
demanding ceremonial purification before approaching
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
God, Hippolytus requires hand-washing (at least) at
morning and midnight; the Canons extend this rule to
all prayer. Tertullian (<i>On Prayer</i> 13) recognizes the
prevalence of the custom and says that Christians
defended it by quoting Matthew 27. 24; he, however,
regards it as pointless. Compare Mark 7. 1-15.</p>
<p>2. Hippolytus doubtless does not think it necessary
to prescribe attendance at the Sunday eucharists, assuming
that no true believer would willingly absent
himself. Regular weekday eucharists were not yet customary,
although they were held at times of special
prayer and fasting;<a class="fn" id="fr_223" href="#fn_223">[223]</a> compare <a href="#tch25_2">25. 2</a>. So the only weekday
meetings he presupposes are gatherings for prayer
and instruction according to the synagogue pattern.
Evidently the emphasis was laid on instruction, with
the Bible as textbook, and those who could read were
expected to follow the passages cited. 1 and 2 Clement
give an idea of the content and style of the teaching,
which would be given by instructors like those of <a href="#tch16_1">16. 1</a>.</p>
<p>3. On occasion local meetings were visited and
addressed by teachers of higher rank, who are described
in terms reminiscent of the New Testament prophets.</p>
<h3><a id="teh36" href="#tch36">36</a></h3>
<p>1. Complete manuscript Bibles were very expensive,
and few lay Christians could have owned one. But
portions of Scripture were within the reach of all.</p>
<p>2-3. Hippolytus follows Mark 15. 25, not John 19. 14,
here. He deduces the hours of the Jewish ceremonies
from his typology; no definite hour is prescribed in the
Old Testament,<a class="fn" id="fr_224" href="#fn_224">[224]</a> while in the Temple the morning
sacrifice was offered before sunrise and the showbread
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
was changed (on the Sabbath) still earlier. He cites
John 10. 14; 6. 50.</p>
<p>4. Mark 15. 33. Hippolytus adds that the darkness
came in answer to (Christ&rsquo;s<a class="fn" id="fr_225" href="#fn_225">[225]</a>) prayer; possibly a conjecture
of his own but more likely a &ldquo;tradition&rdquo;.</p>
<p>5. At the ninth hour, as soon as Christ died, he went
to the lower world and released the spirits in prison,
who rejoiced with a great thanksgiving. The belief was
very widespread<a class="fn" id="fr_226" href="#fn_226">[226]</a> but the other versions seem to miss
the point.</p>
<p>6. <span class="scripRef">John 19. 34</span>. The darkness from the sixth to the
ninth hour, followed by daylight until evening, made
a &ldquo;night&rdquo; and a &ldquo;day&rdquo;; so the Son of Man by Easter
morning had truly been &ldquo;three days and three nights
in the heart of the earth&rdquo; (Matthew 12. 40). Compare
Constitutions <span class="small">V</span>, 14. 9-13.</p>
<p>9. On the custom of rising during the night for
prayer, compare, e.g., Tertullian, <i>To his Wife</i> <span class="small">II</span>, 5.
Hippolytus&mdash;rather more than Tertullian&mdash;insists that
unbelievers should not witness Christian devotions.</p>
<p>10. John 13. 10 repeals the provisions of Leviticus 15. 16-18.</p>
<p>11. Despite the principle just enunciated Hippolytus
cannot rid himself of a belief that a purification is
needed; he compromises by declaring that a small
ceremony will suffice. Compare <a href="#tch37">chapter 37</a>.</p>
<p>12. This quaint doctrine&mdash;which the other versions
omit or alter&mdash;came from the authorities who gave
Hippolytus the rest of his &ldquo;tradition&rdquo;. He mentions
them here only, but in Irenaeus similar appeals to &ldquo;the
presbyters&rdquo; are numerous.</p>
<p>13. Matthew 25. 6, 13 in an unusual text form.</p>
<p>14. Peter&rsquo;s denial (Matthew 26. 74) is synchronized
with the condemnation of Christ by the Sanhedrin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<h3><a id="teh37" href="#tch37">37</a></h3>
<p>The sign of the cross is performed after first breathing
on the hand, so that it is wet with saliva. Belief in the
power of spittle to repel evil spirits is widespread<a class="fn" id="fr_227" href="#fn_227">[227]</a> and,
despite Hippolytus&rsquo;s disclaimer, lies behind the practice
he advocates. His own interpretation of the ceremony
is none the less ingenious; the mixture of moisture and
breath<a class="fn" id="fr_228" href="#fn_228">[228]</a> corresponds to the water and the Spirit in
baptism and so makes the sign of the cross the &ldquo;image&rdquo;
of baptism, accomplishing a sort of rebaptism<a class="fn" id="fr_229" href="#fn_229">[229]</a> (36. 11).
Only Latin A has the original; Latin B and the other
versions do not understand the custom and replace
&ldquo;baptism&rdquo; by &ldquo;the Word&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The interpretation of Exodus 12. 22 is in the style of
Barnabas.</p>
<h3><a id="teh38" href="#tch38">38</a>
<br />CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>Hippolytus closes with a final adjuration to avoid all
novelties; the way of peace consists solely in strict
adherence to the past.</p>
